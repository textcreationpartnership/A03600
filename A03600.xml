            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the 1. <hi>v. perilous dayes ſhall come,</hi> the reaſon of the trouble, and the ground of the miſery, that the Spirit hath foretold, ſhall befall and be brought upon the world, it ſhall not be in regard of the puniſhment inflicted, but in regard of the ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

            <p>The multitude of ſins bring the dangereſt times. When there are the greateſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions committed, there is the greateſt danger to be expected. For the danger of times lyeth not in regard of outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles but in regard of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold corruptions that are in us, and the many evils committed by us, when men are moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the time is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for it is not the power of Satan, nor his wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that can bring miſery to

Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man looke to his owne wayes, and reforme his owne corruptions, and turne from his evill courſes, and then all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and inconveniences will turne away, and God will be a God to us, when they did eate and drinke, and did righteouſly, was it not well with them, I

If we would call and obey him, hee would heare. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. This was the ground of the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> ſo that to humble, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſinnes, is the beſt meanes to maintaine the ſafety of a Kingdome or Nation.</p>
            <p>In the Verſe obſerve two things firſt what Carnall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and curſed diſſemblers will doe, <hi>They have a forme
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19631:6"/> but deny the power.</hi> Secondly, what the carriage of the Saints ſhould be toward theſe, they ſhould turne away, becauſe they turne away from God, and the power of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Hipocrite what he doth, he is onely the picture of godlineſſe, as <hi>Machivel</hi> that curſed polititian ſpeakes, hee would have a man to take up the name of vertue, becauſe there is no trouble in it, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet which comes by it, but hee would not have him take up the practiſe of it. So it is with an Hypocrite, it is eaſie to have a ſhew and appearance, but when it comes to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, and ſtrength of it, he cannot indure it.</p>
            <p>Here is two things to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, before wee come to the doctrine, firſt what is meant by <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> ſecondly what is meant by a <hi>forme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, this word <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19631:6"/> two things, firſt, the doctrine of Religion, which by the Apoſtles is called the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> ſecondly, that implyeth that gracious frame of ſpirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the heart is diſpoſed and the ſoule of a Chriſtian is fitted to expreſſe ſome gratious worke outwardly. For what the oyle is to the wheeles of a clocke, it makes them runne glibber, ſo godlineſſe to the ſoule, when the ſoule is oyled and annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, it is fitted to performe any good duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is meant by the <hi>forme of godlineſſe,</hi> I anſwer, the word <hi>forme</hi> or faſhion, it is taken by way of reſemblance, and ſimilitude from outward things, it is nothing elſe but that outward appearance, that any thing hath, diſcovering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and being of it.

Looke as it is with ſire, let it be raked up never ſo cloſe, yet there will be fire, it will heate, and burne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all into it ſelfe, ſo it is with the ſire of grace in a mans heart, though there be many clogging corruptions, yet if this grace be there, though a man have a great deale of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy noyſome humors of vanity, and coller and anger, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe yet this fire will heat and burne, &amp; make way, &amp; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

            <p>Secondly, it will not onely breake through all corruptions, but through all outward occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that comes againſt it. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 39.3.

            <p>Firſt labour to lay downe all <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>1</label> carnall excellency of thy parts and abilities, and of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſpects that are in thee and God hath beſtowed upon thee, lay downe all thoſe in all thy ſervice, that onely the power of the Lord Ieſus may bee diſcovered to the view of the world, let grace be above all, make that knowne, and lift that up above all other things whatſoever. Marke how carefull <hi>Paul</hi> is to knocke off his owne fingers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. but not I ſaith he he ſhrinks in and will take nothing to himſelfe, it was not I, but the grace of God, which was the author and the cauſe of it, and therefore 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſet up God on the Pinacle, ſo that nothing appeared but Chriſt and his grace: hee lay in the duſt, that the Lord onely might tread upon him, that he onely might be magnified, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19631:19"/> and extolled. I would have a Chriſtian deale in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie as men doe when one lifts another over the wall, he that is lifted up, is onely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but the other is not ſeene, all men may view him, but the other not deſcried: ſo I would have the ſoule lye downe low in the duſt, and at the foote of the Lord, and lay downe all excellency of gifts, that Chriſt and his grace might onely appeare. I would have a Chriſtian heart in reading, praying and profeſſing to ſhew forth Chriſt, onely lye thou hid and beare up the Lord and his grace, that he onely may be preſented to the view of the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>2</label> labour that others may acknowledge that worke of excellency, and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that grace might be ſeene of others but not of our ſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. O that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19631:19"/> Chriſtians would ſo walke and converſe that the whole world might ſee what grace can doe? that men may ſay ſuch a one by nature is marvelous cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, but ſee what grace can doe, hee is very calme and meeke, ſuch a man is a very coward naturally, but ſee what grace can doe, he is couragious for the cauſe of grace: obſerve the difference between a proud and a meeke ſpirit. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Iohn come and ſee, &amp;c.</hi> this is the patterne of a proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for alwayes a vaine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man either beginnes or ends with ſomething of his owne, and if for ſhame hee cannot commend himſelfe, yet hee will ſo expreſſe himſelfe that hee will leave ſome praiſe of himſelfe behind him; if he talkes with ſome great man he will flatter, and fawne, and praiſe the man hee ſpeakes to, ſo that when he is gone, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19631:20"/> may ſay he is a wiſe deſcreet man, &amp; fits every mans humour that it may appeare what parts are in him. This is the temper of a proud man.</p>
            <p>But now take an example of an humble heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12, 13. that was a faire booty to take a great deale of glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, bee it knowne not I, but the name of Ieſus hath made this man whole, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. I am not that great Prophet.</p>
            <p>Labour <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>3</label> that others may bee in love with thee, and labour to bee partakers of it, this wee ought to labour at in all our performances, for wee are but friends to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, and all that wee have to doe is to wooe and winne the hearts of people, not to us but to the Lord Ieſus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. I tell you a holy wife, that hath the worke of grace in her heart, ſhee may ſo behave her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to her husband, that hee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19631:20"/> may ſay, what doth the grace of God worke this? then ſure I will love that word and that grace. The ſervant that ſtands at the ſtall askes the Chapman what will you buy, he doth not ſell for himſelfe, it is his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters commodity: ſo it is in this caſe, a Chriſtian ſhould not ſet out any thing, either parts or gifts to make men buy, but that they might buy grace, and love grace, eſteeme of grace, and rejoyce in the power of grace.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be our ayme and care in ſhewing forth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſſe that others may glorifie God with us, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>4</label> bleſſe God. Men glorified God in <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſaid, O the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable power of God that can thus prevaile, hee that hath beene an oppoſer, now a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Chriſt, men here won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the grace of God. So then labour to expreſſe thy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19631:21"/> grace outwardly when time ſhall ſerve; art thou a holy wife, ſhew thy ſelfe meeke to a churliſh Naball, are you holy ſervants, and yet doe you thinke you may bee way ward and proud, and take one end of the ſtaffe, and thinke your Maſter nor Miſtreſſe may reprove you, this is not a ſhew of godlineſſe but of ſawcineſſe, if you have grace inwardly, ſhew it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and let all the world know what it is to have a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, let them that have no grace be proud, &amp;c. but bee thou meeke, obedient, and lay thy hand on thy mouth, and ſay nothing; O what a glory would come to the name of Chriſt hereby. Carry home the point in hand, maſters, ſervants, fathers and children, have you any goodneſſe, let the world ſee it, let thy father ſee it if thou beeſt a child; let thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter perceive it if thou beeſt a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19631:21"/> ſervant, that the wicked of the world may not ſay, what are your profeſſours, that you talke ſo much of, they are as proud and as peeviſh as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they are as unjuſt as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for ſhame let it never bee ſaid ſo of you, but if you thinke you have any godlineſſe, expreſſe it then, why ſhew it then, the fire cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, the Sunne without heate, ſo if grace be in your hearts it will appeare in your lives.</p>
            <p>Now the ſecond thing is the behaviour of the wicked to this power of godlineſſe, they deny it, that is, they ſubmit not, they cloſe not therewith. As a ſervant that denies ſuch a man to be his maſter, and the maſter deny ſuch a one to bee his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when the one will not owne the other, ſo Hypocrites deale with the vertue of grace &amp; power of holineſſe, they will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19631:22"/> by no meanes beare the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it; looke as it was with <hi>Peter</hi> in another caſe, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Chriſt, as who ſhould ſay, I would not owne him, I doe not belong to him, I owe no ſubjection to him, he hath no authority over mee: ſo many goe under the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but when it commeth to the power of godlineſſe, then you ſay, godlineſſe hath nothing to doe with me, you will doe what ſeemes good in your owne eyes, you fling off the power of godlineſſe and the authority of grace which ſhould rule you. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p>That <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> Hypocrites take up the profeſſion of godlineſſe, but deny the power thereof, to cloſe with it or to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
            <p>For the opening of it two things are to bee diſcovered, firſt, wherein conſiſts the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19631:22"/> of the power of godlineſſe, ſecondly the reaſons why they that outwardly profeſſe it, yet will not ſtoope to the power of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt your carnall Hypocrites deny the power of godlineſſe three wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, partly in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the authoritie of the truth, and acknowledge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of godlines, when they ſay I hope a man may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though he be not ſo exact and preciſe, what though hee ſweare now and then, and hath none but that, ſuch a man I hope may bee an honeſt man and goe to heaven. I ſee no neceſſity put upon a man, that a man muſt thus conforme his life to the rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the ſtrictneſſe that Miniſters call for and require, this is to deny it in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:19631:23"/>
            <p>Secondly in your wills and hearts, when the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to bee framed, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and diſpoſed by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſſe, you will bee proud, and peeviſh, &amp;c. and will walke in your owne wayes, let God ſay what hee will, and the Word command what it pleaſe, though we are damned and goe downe to hell for it, this is a profeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the truth, and of the power of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when we deny it in our practiſe, in our actions, for if a mans actions be naught, this is certaine his heart is naught, this rule will never deceive you, now we come to ſhew the cauſe why a company of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites can ſwallow downe profeſſion, but theſe will onely complement with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but away with the power of it.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:19631:23"/>
            <p>Becauſe godlineſſe and the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> power of it where it comes is of a powerfull nature, of a commanding authority, it will ſubdue all thoſe beloved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, thoſe prevailing luſts which wicked men ſo highly prize and are not content to part withall, therefore they cannot away with the power of it. Take an Vſurer or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, &amp; tell him he muſt make ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or elſe periſh, this goeth to the heart. And I knew ſome of theſe extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that could be content to pay ſome ſmall ſums, but when it comes to 40. or a 100. pounds then they flew off, and for ought I know lived and dyed in their ſinnes. The Adulterer ſaith he muſt have his queanes, the power of godlineſſe ſaith he ſhall not, the drunkard his companions, the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſaith hee muſt not have them, unleſſe hell with them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19631:24"/> now here is the quarrell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take up the ſhow and deny the power thereof.</p>
            <p>The power <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> of godlineſſe is accompanied with a great deale of ſtraightneſſe and painefulneſſe in a Chriſtian courſe, now a carnall man would faine have ſome elbow roome, and goe a broad way, but the way of godlineſſe is thus, and the hypocrite is not able to be pinched, hence hee is not able to beare the power of godlineſſe. Take notice of this, the power of godlineſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a conformity of the whole man in ſpeech, practiſe, courſe and behaviour, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſſe hath an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall juriſdiction, and will rule in your tongue, in your courſe, in your apparrell, in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, nay it requires beſides, the heart and ſinceritie thereof, and this is ſtraight and difficult, therefore they deny it.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:19631:24"/>
            <p>The power of godlineſſe is <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> ſevere, and ſharpe, and keene, and cuts to the quicke, it ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackes mens conſciences, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles mens ſoules, and will not let them alone, therefore it cannot be endured; when the power of godlineſſe comes it will make a man ſee upon what ground hee goeth, and with what evidence of life and ſalvation, <hi>Gal</hi> 6.4. as who ſhould ſay, many men thinke themſelves ſome body in the world, but they are nothing when they come to the triall, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.9.21. before God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his eyes he thought he was in a good courſe but afterwards it was otherwiſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Outward hypocrites can lie, cheate, ſweare and be drunke for company, and goe away and never bee troubled, they ſay, they will repent and hope God will pardon them, &amp;c. but the power ſaith, oh thoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19631:25"/> diſtempers of heart are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſinke your ſoules into hell for ever, this now vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and then away goes godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe deniers and oppoſers of godlineſſe may bee referred to three ſorts or rankes.</p>
            <p>Such as openly and cauſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily continue in the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſinne in any kind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their conſcience hath beene convicted and after their judgement hath beene infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and alſo the nature of the ſinne, and the condemnation due unto it out of the Word hath beene diſcovered, theſe doe undoubtedly diſcover unto the world, that as yet they have no worke of true grace wrought in their ſoules. I doe not ſay they that commit onely hainous ſinnes and continue in them, as drunkards, &amp;c. but thoſe that lye in and ordinarily take up the practiſe of any evill
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19631:25"/> which is knowne, theſe have not the worke of grace in their hearts. I know Gods Saints oftentimes trip and are taken aſide, but ordinarily to take up the practiſe of any evill cannot have true grace. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a common and ordinary ſwearer, a common prophaner of the Lords day, a man may paſſe this concluſion upon ſuch perſons to be graceleſſe, this is ſeene, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.7. as if hee had ſaid, many will beare you in hand, that they are honeſt and holy, but let no man deceive you, tis not ſaying but he that doth righteouſly is righteous. And he that committeth ſin is of the divell, but you will ſay, doth not every one commit ſinne, no, he that is ſaid to fall into ſinne is not ſaid to commit ſinne, but hee that takes up a trade in ſinne, it is his occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14 9. The Lawyer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19631:26"/> goes up to <hi>London</hi> in Tearme time, but he hath his Vacation time too, ſo ſinners have their Vacation time, the Drunkard, Vſurer, Adulterer have their Vacation times, but ſo ſoone as the terme time comes, ſo ſoone as the occaſion is offorded, and the opportunity offered they fall to their old trade. Now if you ſee theſe men, you may know him, hee is one of the limbes of Sathan, hee is one of impes of the Divell, and in truth a child of the Divell ſo long as hee remaines in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; hee doth not ſay, hee falls now and then into an evill way, he is now and then taken aſide, but the rode wherein all travells is a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty way, the gameſter ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to gaming, &amp;c. that ſame ſetting of the Bias of the ſoule in an evill way, and the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſame in a mans pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, certaine yet hee is in the

               </gap>1. this word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, ſuch as will beare no yoak; it is their ordinary courſe to ſhake off the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, as Drunkards, &amp;c. are children of <hi>Belial,</hi> their hearts are baſe, and their lives as bad as their hearts; but you will ſay, their hearts may bee good for all this; nay I ſay they cannot, how prove you this? I anſwer, thou tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt me ſo, that is, thy life and converſation doth teſtifie it; the drunkard ſaith, I am a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious drunkard, beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe men, and Angells, and friends, and neighbours, they proclaime it to madde men and children. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes,</hi> hence I conclude, faith inwardly may be ſeene by workes outwardly; then I conclude alſo that hee may his infidelity too by his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19631:27"/> workes, if grace be expreſſed by precious workes, then a mans baſe heart may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried by baſe practiſes. No Phiſitian ſees the heart when he tryeth whether his diſeaſe be in the heart, but hee feeleth his pulſe, but if that bee vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and violent, hee ſaith his heart is very much diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Happily I doe not ſee the wheeles of a Clocke, but when it ſtrikes, I know it mooves: So it is herein, doe not thinke that you may have good hearts, and yet wicked lives, No, no, I can feele your hearts by your pulſe, if your converſation be naught your hearts are worſer. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.3.

            <p>Communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is twofold,
<list>
                  <item>Publike,</item>
                  <item>Private.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Publike concernes the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Congregation, and it is an open mee<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vertue of publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to partake of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Three things obſerve in the deſcription, firſt there muſt be an open meeting, becauſe it is in the Congregation, the Congregation is like to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paſtures, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for every mans Cattle, ſo the ordinances of God are common paſtures for every one, ſecondly it is by vertue of publike authority, for that is obſerved of <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> that hee opened the temple doores, ſo that publike authority gives warrant to publike meetings, thirdly is the ſharing of men together in the holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of God.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:19631:31"/>
            <p>Now the queſtion groweth on, how farre is it lawfull for the Saints of God to converſe with thoſe that are common ſwearers, and drunkards, and adulterers, and the like for the preſent; what are theſe rules.</p>
            <p>The rules are two, firſt thoſe that have publike authority in their hands, they to whom God hath committed authority over others, ſuch as are eyther ſcandalouſly naught, or openly prophane, ſhould by them bee excommunicated, as wee may ſee by the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corrinth.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Matthew</hi> 18.15.</p>
            <p>The ſecond rule ſuppoſe they that are in authority will not ſeparate them, the ſecond rule then is this, yet the Saints of God ſhould not abſtaine from the Congregation, it is pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indeede, and the thing is troubleſome and tedious to a gratious heart, and wee muſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19631:31"/> mourne for it, but being it is not in my power I muſt not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine, I know there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objections and cavills of the Anabaptiſts againſt this, and they thus reply.</p>
            <p>This ought to be done, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> that ſuch perſons ſhould be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, therefore why ſhould I enjoy communion with the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I anſwer it is true, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> wee muſt mourne for it, &amp; as King <hi>Iames</hi> ſaid of the abuſe of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, it is a ſhame in the Church, but that part is yours to whom authority belongs.</p>
            <p>But they caſt this as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon our Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon drunkards they ſay, and ſwearers if they do but pay 2. pence for their offering at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, may receive the Supper of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Wee confeſſe this fault, let it lie where it is, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, we can onely mourne
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19631:32"/> for it, and that God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. there they bring Scripture for it. If there bee any Adulterer or uncleane perſon ſaith the Text among you, let him not eate, that is communicate with him ſay they.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, I ſay to eate, there is not referred to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in eating the body of Chriſt, but eate not with him, that is, be not familiar with ſuch a perſon, and it includes the word familiarity not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Lords Table. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9. There eating implyeth a common inward familiarity, <hi>my owne familiar friend, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> yet they reply againe from the greater to the leſſe, if wee may not eate with them privately, then much leſſe publikely may wee communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cate with them.</p>
            <p>It <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> is no good reaſon, becauſe I have more authority to refuſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19631:32"/> the company of a man in my owne houſe then I have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him in the open Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, I can keepe a man out of my houſe, but I cannot fling him out of the open congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that belongs onely to thoſe that are in place and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Conſtant communion is that, when there lyeth ſuch a bond upon a bondman, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not breake this communion, ſuch is the communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the husband and the wife ſo having hired a ſervant, nor the ſervant from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter when he pleaſe untill the covenants be fulfilled, this is conſtant communion.</p>
            <p>The queſtion now is, how farre a man may turne unto the wicked, ſuch as are openly wicked</p>
            <p>The rules of the queſtion are three.</p>
            <p>Firſt for a faithfull man,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19631:33"/> when he hath his liberty, then to enter into communion with the wicked is unlawfull, as for a free ſervant to make choiſe of an ungratious maſter, and ſo for a holy maſter to make choiſe of a wicked ſervant, ſo for a good woman being ſingle to make choiſe of a wicked man, or for a holy man to chuſe a wicked wife.</p>
            <p>If <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>2</label> a ſervant bee entred into covenant with an unrighteous maſter, or a wife to a wicked husband, they are bound as long as thoſe bonds laſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and humbly to ſubject themſelves to all ſervices that are required of perſons in their place and condition.</p>
            <p>As <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>3</label> God affords libertie and opportunity in a good way and a good conſcience, every man is bound to ſever himſelfe from ſuch as are wicked and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly naught; now for a ſervant, thy yeare being out
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19631:33"/> fly the houſe, thou that art a prentiſe, when thy yeares are expired loſe thy ſelfe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thy heart from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>Now we come to mutable, or voluntary private commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Voluntary communion is a cloſure with ſuch in common company and inward familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo as when occaſion ſerves they may all alter and change againe.</p>
            <p>In the mutable communion obſerve theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a cloſing and faſtning together, a meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring of men together, ſo farre as occaſion drives them one to another, or elſe as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection drawes them one to another, and therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 63 the word tranſlated, a friend, ſignifieth a companion, that is the firſt paſſage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the propriety
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19631:34"/> or quality of this communion in the next words, it is a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in common company, and familiarity, when they cloſe one with another in common converſation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.7. ſo wicked company one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in drinking, ſwearing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They are joyned together in inward familiarity, when there is a cloſure and combining one with another, when the ſoules of ſundry men are Cabbins to keepe the counſailes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets one of another, <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.14. the word there tranſlated a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar is a man of ſecrets, ſo we may ſee it in the example of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the Text ſaith that the ſoule of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> was knit to the ſoule of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, they ſo cloſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon company and inward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is in a mans power as occaſion ſerves, to change
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19631:34"/> eyther this company or familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, therefore wee call it mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table communion becauſe there is no bond nor tie lyeth upon a man to ingage himſelfe to his company, but as occaſion is offered, a man may turne the backe to a baſe fellow that hath cozoned him, this I take to be the communion mainely here intended, though the other are included, but this volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſociety I thinke is that the Apoſtle here ſpecially aimes at. Hence,</p>
            <p>It is the duty of all the Saints of God, not to cloſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and unneceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and inward familiarity with thoſe that are the deniers of the power of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>I ſay meetely obſerve the Saints muſt not cloſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unneceſſary commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the wicked, I call it unneceſſary, becauſe a man may bee forced ſometimes to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19631:35"/> keepe company with profane men, as for example theſe three bonds force him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Bond.</hi>
               </note>Sometimes the bond of a mans calling will force him to keepe company with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as the Magiſtrate muſt bee ordinarily in the company of the wicked to reforme them, the Phiſitian among his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the Miniſter among his people, the Lawyer among his clients; ſo Inkeepers, the Law will force them to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a ſtranger, and to give him that which is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Bond.</hi>
               </note>The bond of humanity and civilitie, that binds a man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to keepe company with the wicked, as the bond of neighbourhood, for example, people that live in the ſame place or towne, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to conſult about the affaires of the towne and other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one with another.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:19631:35"/>
            <p>The bonds of Religion and naturall mercy binds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to keepe company with ſuch,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Bond.</hi>
               </note> for the ſoules of all men ſhould labour to doe good unto all, ſo farre as neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and opportunity is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereunto, for wee are bound to preſerve the honour, life, goods, good name of any man, what ever he be, be the company never ſo wicked yet the duty is good and holy.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay wee muſt not cloſe with men in unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary communion, ſo farre wee muſt turne away from them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. withdraw your ſelves from them, it is a compariſon taken from full Sailes, when the Sailes of a ſhippe are drawne, and it hath full ſaile, it goeth very ſwiftly: So ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, doe not ſtrike ſaile, doe not freely expreſſe your ſelves in familiarity with him, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19631:36"/> withdraw your ſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8 ſhut the dore againſt them, ſo you ſee the point is cleare.</p>
            <p>For our better direction ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe three particulars, firſt ſomething by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, how far the limits of turning from the wicked doth goe, ſecondly the reaſons why wee muſt turne away, thirdly the uſe and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Where may wee ſet the bounds and compaſſe of our familiarity with the wicked? for this wee muſt remember theſe two paſſages, ſome that deny godlineſſe make it their trade and practiſe, ſecondly others onely deny it upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and though they have grace yet from both theſe wee muſt turne away.</p>
            <p>But <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> firſt touching the former that are knowne to be wicked men, ſuch as are openly naught, how farre ſhall wee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19631:36"/> carry our ſelves familiar to wards theſe.</p>
            <p>In theſe particulars, firſt, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> partly in regard of the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, ſecondly of the outward behaviour of our lives: In both theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we muſt turne away.</p>
            <p>Firſt how farre muſt the heart of a good man bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from the company and familiaritie of thoſe that are ſcandalouſly wicked?</p>
            <p>I anſwer the rules are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Saints <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>1</label> of God are bound to have a vile eſteeme and a baſe account of thoſe that are ſuch vile and baſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Let the Word of God rule us in this, and let us bee commanded by it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15 4. Obſerve two paſſages, firſt, every wicked man is a vile man, ſecondly, they ſhould deſpiſe and contemne them, it is a badge of a Chriſtian, the note of a holy heart in whoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19631:37"/> eyes a wicked man is vile, a vile drunkard, a vile adulterer, &amp;c. it is not a matter of liberty, but of neceſſity, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.20. it is marvelous lying ſo to doe. The Scripture ſtiles wicked men dogs, hogs, and fooles, what the Scripture ſaith, wee ought to give eare unto, a drunken man a foole, a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man a foole, &amp;c. if wee judge not ſo, wee judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Where wicked men thinke it a pride and audacity for Gods Saints to eſteeme baſely of them, it is no ſuch matter, be you better and they will judge better of you; ſhould a man judge that to be Gold which is droſſe, that to be Silver which is Lead, ſhould we judge you to have the love of God when you have none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſoule <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>2</label> of a gratious man is marvelous ſecretly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, leaſt it ſhould be infected
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19631:37"/> with ſuch wicked perſons, this will follow from the former by cleare, and evident, and ſound ground; that which the ſoule abhors and that which the heart is carried with abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt, there cannot but a ſeparation will follow, and he muſt needs be marvelous jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of being tainted thereby.</p>
            <p>Now wee come to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing which was the outward behaviour and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and this alſo may ſhew a diſlike.</p>
            <p>How farre muſt our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage be turned away from a wicked man.</p>
            <p>How ſhould a man carry himſelfe toward the wicked of the world, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> muſt he expreſſe no point of love unto them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer you muſt beare a great deale of love towards them, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> and you ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a great deale of affection to them and doe a great many
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19631:38"/> ſervices for them, and they are three eſpecially.</p>
            <p>You muſt labour to have a ſpirit of campaſſion, and to mourne inwardly, and be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved throughly for the ſinnes that are in them, and for the manifeſt miſeries they plucke upon themſelves, this was the behaviour of our Saviour Chriſt, Oh <hi>Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> If ever you have had any relliſh of mercy and compaſſion from the Lord Ieſus, O then pitty thoſe that want this pitty; when you ſee a company of drunkards ſtaggering and a company of blaſphemers ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Almighty, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their ſoules in the pit of deſtruction for ever, if you have any mercy, any bowells of compaſſion within you, let your eyes drop downe teares in ſecret and mourne and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the miſery and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſuch poore creatures,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19631:38"/> happily enemies to God, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily enemies to thee, but what of that? wee our ſelves were once haters and hated of God, and ran the broad way to Hell and everlaſting deſtruction, therefore ſhew pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to ſuch poore ſoules, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.17. Oh pitty them poore creatures, they know not what they doe, if you houle and mourne in ſecret inwardly for the confuſion that is like to fall upon their poore ſoules, and thinke with your ſelves, what muſt all thoſe curſed drunkards and wretched Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and wicked blaſphemers live here ſinfully, and periſh everlaſtingly, and goe downe to hell and grave, there in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments never to bee comforted, never to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed? if you have any bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of compaſſion, you cannot but mourne for them</p>
            <p>Prayer for them in ſecret,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19631:39"/> when thou art praying to God, and ſeeking to the Lord for mercy for thy ſelfe, put into the ſame prayer all thoſe that are in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity, put up a petition for the drunkard, put up a petitition for the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, as thou deſireſt God to ſave thy ſoule, ſo intreate the Lord to turne the heart of the drunkard, &amp;c. Remember what <hi>Abraham</hi> did for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> O let <hi>Iſhmael</hi> live in thy ſight Lord, ſo pray you, Oh that ſuch a drunkard might have his life amended, O that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fane heart may live in thy ſight Lord.</p>
            <p>You muſt uſe all meanes to reclame them, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them ſharpely, counſell them compaſſionately, and ſtrive with them mightily that ſo you may bring them home to know the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their peace here, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19631:39"/> everlaſting happines hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now we are to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee muſt not turne from ſuch as heretofore have not beene noted to be wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ſuch as hath receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercy and favour from the Lord.</p>
            <p>It may be in theſe two caſes that followes, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> that is not onely left to a mans liberty, but a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of neceſſity, which God hath laid upon us to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from ſuch.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have profeſſed Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Caſe.</hi>
               </note> and approved themſelves outwardly to the Church of Chriſt, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruptions or temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or occaſions preſſing in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they fall foulely and ſcandalouſly into ſome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, offence, then wee ſhould turne away from having any inward ſociety with them for the while, till they have upon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19631:40"/> ſufficient proofe by their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and reformation, and if it be poſſible they have given ſatisfaction publikely to the Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. the reaſon of this is pregnant, for the truth is, ſuch falls give a good ground of ſuſpition, that there was never yet any ſound grace wrought in their hearts; I doe not ſay a ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but of ſuſpition, that the worke was not ſound, nor this grace ſincere in the heart, becauſe he hath ſinned ſo foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fallen ſo fearefully. For how ever the Saints fall ſo foulely, yet this is ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable, it is not ordinary, as few be drunke, few commit adultery after their converſion, they have their infirmities and weakeneſſes, and though they may fall extraordinarily, yet ever obſerve as that their fall is foule, ſo their repentance is great, as in <hi>David, He roared,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19631:40"/> &amp;c.</hi> and marke it, after the Saints of God have repented of their falls, who ever read that they fell into the ſame ſins againe.</p>
            <p>A man that hath lived in the boſome of the Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 2.</note> and hath beene conceived and judged in the courſe of reaſon and charity to be in the ſtate of grace, yet notwithſtanding if he come to this paſſe, that hee is obſtinately incorrigible, though the fault be but ſmall, and not knowne of many, if yet he will not yeeld, when all arguments are anſwered, and all pleas removed, then ſhake hands with him, and have no familiarity with him for the time. This I take to be the ſcope of the Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. It skils not what the matter of the fault be, but what the incorrigibleneſſe of the parties. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. obſerve it, it is very reaſonable a man
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19631:41"/> ſhould doe ſo, for he that will not receive good by the ſociety of the members of Chriſt, it is fit hee ſhould be caſt out from having any communion with the members of Chriſt. For what is the end of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that men might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; now if a man will not heare nor be convinced, it is fit he ſhould be deprived of the comfort of the ſocietie of the Saints. I reaſon thus, he that may be excommunicated pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, may be ſeparated pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from the company and intimate ſocietie of the Saints; but he that is obſtinately incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible may be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated publikely, therefore hee may be ſeparated from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the Saints.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19631:51"/> forſake the Lord in the time of proſperity, were faine to flie to him in time of adverſitie for ſuccour: And therefore wee ſhall ſee how earneſtly they cry unto the Lord, in the tenth <hi>Verſe;</hi> heavie afflictions breed hearty prayers and earneſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; their puniſhment was not ſo grievous, but their prayers were as hot and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>They cried to the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Text.</p>

            <p>In the generall, before wee come to the maine, ſee here the deniall of the Lord to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they ſought him, and cried unto him. The Point is this, <hi>Thoſe that come unto God in prayer in their ſins,</hi>

Would you ſo call that the Lord may heare you when you call? then waſh your hands in innocencie and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his Altar: this is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell God gave, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.17. <hi>Ceaſe to doe evill, learne to doe well:</hi> and then whatſoever your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations be, they ſhall be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19631:54"/> pardoned, whatſoever your miſeries be, I will eaſe you, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10.17, 18. The Lord prepares the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to call upon him, a heart mourning for ſinne, and a heart looſned from ſinne: when you leave ſinne behinde you, and ſend up a prayer from an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart and a broken ſoule, then God will heare you, and you ſhall receive an anſwer from the God of heaven, as he ſeeth you have moſt neede to carrie you on in a Chriſtian courſe. In the Verſe there are three things obſerveable: He ſaith, <hi>I will not deliver you,</hi> goe to your gods let them comfort you, for my part, I have no comfort, no mercy for ſuch as you are, thoſe gods you ſerved in proſperity goe to them now for ſuccour in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: In the Verſe it ſelfe, take notice of three things; firſt, that God doth deliver his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19631:54"/> Church, for that is preſumed, <hi>I will deliver you no more</hi> (as who ſhould ſay) I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you, and protected you and the like: God takes this for granted, and they found this by experience. Secondly, God ſometimes denieth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to his people, I have done ſo, but now <hi>I will deliver you no more;</hi> I have no more mercy for you to ſuccour you in the day of trouble. Thirdly we have the cauſe of this: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> that is, becauſe you have ſerved other gods, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away from my worſhip, becauſe you will not reforme your wicked wayes, <hi>I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you no more</hi> Firſt, for the former, <hi>God doth deliver his Church.</hi> The Doctrine is this, <label type="milestone">

               </label> The Scriptures are marvellous pregnant in the proofe of this, two or three witneſſes will caſt the cauſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3 <hi>laſt.</hi> The Prophet <hi>David</hi> attributeth this as a matter of proprietie to the Lord, <hi>Salvation belongs unto the Lord;</hi> it is not to be underſtood of ſpirituall redemption onely, but alſo of temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the time of trouble: It is that obſerveable, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.8. It is as I may ſo ſay, one of Gods Names whereby hee is knowne to his Church, and whereby he ſhewes himſelfe, <hi>Oh, thou the hope of Iſrael, and the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble.</hi> It is not meant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſpirituall redemption ſtill, but in regard of temporall deliverance from thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that doe betide, and thoſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19631:55"/> grievances that lie upon, and thoſe heavie burthens that preſſe downe the Church of God, and therefore how ever it is true, there are many meanes uſed, and many helpes appointed by God for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good; yet it is not men, it is not the policie of the wiſe, it is not the power of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is not the fence of the Walls, nor the ſtrength of the Caſtles, it is not the number of the Souldiers, nor the skill of the army: but it is the Lord that is the deliverer of his people, as we may ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44 4 <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

It is that the Lord takes unto himſelfe, ſalvation is mine, preſervation is mine, the iſſues of life and death, are onely in the hand of the Lord, the point then is plaine enough, we will open the ground of it, the which the cauſe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, being a remembrance of that miraculous deliverance from the Gunpowder Treaſon; The grounds of the point, are foure, The firſt is this, God is infinitely wiſe, and onely knowes how to deliver his people, men are driven to their wits end many times, they ſee no meanes offered, no meanes appointed, they can ſinde no cauſe how to ſuccour themſelves in the time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, but he is an experienced deliverer, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. God knowes how to deliver his, when enemies are practiſing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19631:56"/> beneath, and digging deepe in their devices, the Lord ſits in heaven, and ſeeth all, and laughes at them; all their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes he obſerves them, nay the Lord knowes all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, policies, and engines, which the wicked purpoſes to contrive, before they contrive them, as when <hi>David</hi> was in <hi>K<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as God onely knowes, all the engines and policies and practiſes of the wicked, when they are devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the depth of the earth, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh: Let them doe what they will, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19631:57"/> endeavour what they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo cunningly and ſecretly, the Lord knowes them. But ſecondly, the Lord is onely able and ſufficient to deliver his in want of meanes, above meanes, nay againſt meanes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11 When <hi>Aſa</hi> was in great extremity, when there was five hundred thouſand came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, the greateſt Army we read of in holy Scriptures, and not many more in profane Stories, the Text ſaith, <hi>Hee cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, thou canſt deliver by many or by few;</hi> God could ſave <hi>Aſa</hi> and his Nobles, though he had no Army at all; for obſerve it, this All-ſufficiencie and abilitie of God, in delivering his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in time of troubles, will diſcover it ſelfe in three bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and they are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this ſecond generall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Lord provides meanes, before any meanes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19631:57"/> can be <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. the laſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe,</hi> all the ſhields of the earth are the Lords; all the ſhields in <hi>Spaine, Germany</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> they are all the Lords, all meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are, have their being from the Lord, and <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.16. the Text ſaith, there was no Smith before God created him, nor no coales before God made them, ſo that there are no meanes but they came from God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God workes with all meanes before they can worke, as there is no meanes unleſſe God provide them; ſo the meanes that ar<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unleſſe God worke with them, <hi>Pſal</hi> 18.34.39. we ſhall obſerve it, God doth not onely give <hi>David</hi> armes, but hee teacheth his armes to warre he doth not onely give <hi>D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vid</hi> hands, but he teaches his hands to fight, he doth not onely give
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19631:58"/> him ſtrength, but hee girdeth him with ſtrength to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, ſo that all meanes in the world, further than God is pleaſed to goe out with them, they are like the withered hand of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> when the Prophet cried againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſtretched out his hand, and he would plague the Prophet, and he would impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon him, but alas, his hand withered, ſo all the armies, all the plots and policies, are like withered hands, unleſſe the Lord come with them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is the Lord that gives ſucceſſe to all the meanes, when they are improved for the deliverance of his Church; ſo that as there is no meanes un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord provide them, as thoſe meanes can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unleſſe the Lord worke with them: ſo theſe meanes can obtaine no iſſue, they can compaſſe no good, unleſſe the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19631:58"/> Lord be pleaſed graciouſly to breath upon them, and give ſucceſſe unto them: therefore when the <hi>Midianites</hi> thought to have carried all before them, and quite to overthrow the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they had a mighty army, yet the Lord defeated their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and turned their ſwords into their owne bowels. Thus we ſee the ability and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the Lord in delivering his people, it is he that gives all meanes, it is he that workes with all meanes, it is he that gives ſucceſſe to all meanes. In the third place, the Lord is marvellous gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and tender over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as he is every way ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for to doe them good, ſo he is marvellous carefull of their good, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.9. in all their afflictions he was afflicted; many a man hath power and wiſedome and all, he knowes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19631:59"/> how to helpe another, yet he wants a heart, he wants pitty and compaſſion whereby hee may lend ſuccour to thoſe that ſtand in neede thereof: but it is not ſo with God, but in all the afflictions of his people, he is afflicted with them; in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, he is in trouble with them; in all baniſhment he is in baniſhment with them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as the Lord is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and loving and free and tender-hearted toward his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as ready to helpe them as they are ready to call upon him; ſo laſtly, the Lord is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous watchfull, to doe that which he is able and willing to doe: we know what the Text ſaith, <hi>Pſal</hi> 121.4. <hi>Hee that keepeth Iſrael, neither ſlumbers nor ſleepes.</hi> Nay, he is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding zealous for <hi>Iſrael:</hi> That is the phraſe of the Prophet: Let us ſumme up the Point then, and ſee the iſſue of all, and the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19631:59"/> caſe will be marvelous cleare: If it be ſo, that God onely knowes how to deliver his people, if he be able to doe what he knowes, if he be mercifull to doe what hee is able, and if he be watchfull to doe what he is willing, then God muſt needs be the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his Church.</p>
            <p>We come now to the uſe of the Point, and ſo we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the next. It is great pitty that we ſhould ſo behave our ſelves, that this God ſhould not ſuccour us; but ſay, He will deliver us no more, but let us make uſe of the Point in hand. And the Vſe we are to make is this;</p>
            <p>Is it ſo, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>
               </label> that the Lord is the Author of all the deliverance and ſuccour of his ſervants: 1. Then it muſt teach us a point of wiſedome, namely, to whom we muſt give the praiſe of all our marvelous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19631:60"/> and preſervation wee have enjoyed, to whom it is, wee ought to render all the glory of our protection and ſafetie, that hath beene conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the ſpace of above ſixtie yeares to this Kin<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19631:60"/> or courage, or meanes that have done it. Therefore let us doe as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth, in the 44. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> It was not my Bow that did ſuccour me, it was the Lord that hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me, and relieved me, and his be the praiſe for ever: and if all people ſhould doe this, and ought to doe this, then I had almoſt ſaid, nay, why may I not ſay ſo, why ſhould wee not doe it more than all the world beſides, for whence comes it, whence is it, that the Lord hath had an eye unto mee above all the reſt, when the fire of Gods fury hath flamed and conſumed all the country round about us; <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> when the fire hath thus burnt up all, yet this little Cottage, this little <hi>England,</hi> this Spanne of ground, that this ſhould not be ſearched, nay when the ſword hath ruinated, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19631:61"/> all the other parts of Chriſtendome, where the name of the Lord Ieſus is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, we ſit under our Vines and Figtrees, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our ſtreets, our wives are not husbandleſſe, our children are not father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: marke the reaſon and ground of all, is nothing elſe but Gods mercy towards us, and above all, here is ſeene the abundant goodneſſe of the Lord, notwithſtanding our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we yet continue to be a nation, there is no other reaſon to be given of this, but Gods love will have it ſo, when as in other Countries, here one is baniſhed from his houſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his country, that we are here this day to call upon the Name of the Lord, this is evidence enough that it is the Lord that delivers <hi>England:</hi> and ſhall the Lord doe this, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19631:61"/> ſhall not wee acknowledge it, ſhall not we obſerve it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it for ever, ſhall not wee ſcore up the kindneſſe of the Lord, and ſet up pillars of his preſervation and records of his mercy to our ſoules for ever; and above all other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, that in 88. was a great deliverance, but we ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially record that upon the fifth of <hi>November:</hi> this wee record unto all poſteritie; and let us but caſt our thoughts upon the malice of our enemies, and then it cannot but be confeſſed that the Lord hath delivered us: it is the Lords owne worke; and this ſhall appeare, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the practiſe of the wicked, and the deliverance of the Lord together agreeably, three things in the former may be obſerved, three things in the latter may be conſidered, and doth ſhew that God onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, if we looke to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19631:62"/> of Gods grace and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, three things will make it appeare, that none but the devill could deviſe that plot, and if on the other ſide, wee conſider the ſuccour and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance the Lord did lend, it will appeare that none but the Lord could deliver us and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and relieve us. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider three things in the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder plot. Firſt, obſerve their policie; ſecondly, their malice; thirdly, their ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby it will appeare, that they intended the whole ruine, not onely of us, but of the Goſpell, they thought to have carried the matter ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, that it ſhould never have beene ſpied, nay, ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, that it ſhould never have beene recovered; firſt, for the former, behold in the fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>front the depth of their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie the place, that is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fit, the conveiance mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19631:62"/> eaſie the pretence mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous unſuſpected, for they have a ſeller, it is in the earth, and hard by the water that they may convey things thither: and what can be alleadged bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than barrells of beere for a ſeller, and therefore no man queſtioned or imagined, that there was any matter of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intended againſt the State: Secondly, as their policie was great, ſo the rage of theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons was beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure helliſh; for murther is ſo unnaturall, that the earth groanes under it, and the Sunne bluſhes to behold a murtherer: but to ſtay a Magiſtrate, the Law of Nations and Civilitie loathes it, but to lay hands upon the anointed of the Lord Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion, and the law of all Nations condemnes it to the pit of hell. It was not the bloud of a ſubject they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpill, nor of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19631:63"/> that they did deſire to take, nor yet the bloud of the King they ſought for, but when the beſt of the Cominaltie and Gentrie of the Land were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, the choiſeſt of the Nobles and the Councell, the King himſelf, the higheſt of all degrees, and the choiſeſt of all eſtates, when King, Queene, and Nobles were there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the glory of God, and to enact good lawes for this Common wealth, now theſe in that place in one houre, in one inſtant ſhould all have beene miſerably blowne up and torne in peeces, ſo they ſhould not have beene found, or being found, ſhould not have beene knowne that they might be buried according to their degree: This is that matchleſſe villany, and that unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able trechery, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts had contrived, and had not God delivered us (bleſſed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19631:63"/> be his name, he did ſo) but had he not delivered us, we may eaſily conceive what the ſucceſſe would have beene. Oh the lamentable confuſion that would have beene in every corner of the land, when a mans goods ſhould have beene taken from him, and no law to helpe him, nay, his liberty ſhould have beene deprived of, and his bloud ſhould have beene ſhed, and no man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; therefore ſince this might have beene; and ſince the Lord hath preſerved us, that it is not ſo, ſcore up this goodneſſe, and thinke of this kindeneſſe of the Lord. This is the fruit of Popery, and the practiſe of the Papiſts. Oh that you would loath ſuch ſavage crueltie worſe than hell it ſelfe. Adde hereunto the third thing we muſt take notice of, if any thing more may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to manifeſt the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19631:64"/> of the fact, the actors of the worke tooke the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, that they might not goe backe from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance hereof: what curſed wretches were theſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commit ſinne, but to make the Lord the Author of it, nay, to make the Sacrament the ſcale of the deſolation of the Church: Could the devill doe more, I thinke he could ſcarce endevour to doe worſe: this was their policie, and it ſhould have beene our miſery, if the Lord had not delivered us. Thus we ſee the policy, their malice and reſolution that we are defended from this malice of theirs, and ſuccoured from this policie of theirs, there is no other reaſon can be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the Lord is the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his people; it was by his, power that wee were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that we are a Nation this day, it was the Lords
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19631:64"/> worke, and to him we ought to returne all the praiſe; ſo much for the firſt Vſe of the Point.</p>
            <p>The ſecond uſe is this If God <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> be the deliverer of his people: Then it is a great ground of confidence to beare up the hearts of poore ſoules in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if God will deliver, who can deſtroy, if God will keepe, who can hurt: thinke of this in the day of triall, and in the time of extremitie, thinke of this that God never leaves nor forſakes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he will ſay to the South, give up, and to the North bring backe my ſervants from farre, and my daughters from the end of the earth: We that are aſſembled here, if it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, many of us had beene ſcattered, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have beene borne ſince had not now beene here: Therefore if the Lord ſhall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19631:65"/> ſhall ſend deſolation upon the Land, and wee be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered one from another, yet uphold your hearts and ſuſtaine your ſoules, the Lord will ſay to the South give up, and to the North keepe not backe, but bring my ſervants from farre, and my daughters from the end of the earth, he will reſtore thoſe little ones againe, and they ſhall live to praiſe his Name, and magnifie the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his power, he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver againſt all meanes, againſt all hopes and expectations; thinke this againſt the time of trouble: the enemy is very ſtrong, and we are weake, if you expect any ſtrange extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity intended againſt us, thinke of this againſt that time, though the policie malice and power of the enemy be great, and we are weake and feeble, yet the Lord is ſtill the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his ſervants, and behold
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19631:65"/> the ſalvation of the Lord, the Lord hath power enough ſtill, and can over-power the power of the enemy, the Lord hath wiſedome ſtill, and can defeate the policy of thy enemy: thinke of this, and heare for after times.</p>
            <p>The laſt Vſe is an Vſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: <label type="milestone">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19631:72"/> comes on, when is this time, what is this eſtate, when the Lord wil not deliver any more, how ſhall we know it? when may we feare it? how ſhall we judge of this condition of a people when it is thus with them? Give me leave firſt to diſcover it in generall, and then deſcend to particulars, the caſe in the generall is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, the time when and what the condition is, when the Lord will not deliver, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. this is evidently ſet forth. The Text ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the fourth generation that ſhould come of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhold come into the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> but why ſhould they not come now? becauſe, ſaith the Text, the ſinnes of the <hi>Amorites</hi> are not yet full and perfectly ripe: this is the reaſon why <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity ſhall not take poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for the preſent, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19631:72"/> that if the ſinne of the <hi>Amorites</hi> had beene now full, the Lord would have brought his people into <hi>Canaan</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the <hi>Amorites,</hi> they ſhould not have continued, but becauſe they were not yet ripe, therefore the Lord doth ſtill beare with them; ſo then when the ſinne of a Nation comes to full ripeneſſe and perfection, then the truth is the Lord will ſave and deliver no more; now the ripeneſſe of an eſtate and condition will appeare in two things, as it is in other things, in fruit, and in the body of a man; wee ſay a child is come to full growth when two things befall him: when he hath attained his full big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and when he is come to be full of ſtrength, we ſay then, he is as good a man as ever hee will be; ſo it is in the nature of ſinne: when ſinne is come to the full bigneſſe and ſtrength
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19631:73"/> and power it is the deadly ſymptome of deſolation and confuſion of a Nation where ſuch kinde of ſinnes are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marke it, this is the cauſe generally to be obſerved and concluded.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and here I muſt ſtay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, becauſe the point lieth here, and I muſt ſhew two things, firſt, when ſinne is come to the full bigneſſe, and when it is come to the full ſtrength and ripeneſſe, and when theſe two are proved, the Caſe will be cleare; when a deſtruction of a people is determined of God, and will be effected by God: theſe things belong to every ſoule of you, if you have not hearts of Chriſtians about you, but even of humanitie, as you are men, that belong to the ſame Country, and live in the ſame Nation, theſe things belong unto you, therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19631:73"/> thereunto. And firſt, <hi>I</hi> will open the firſt thing, and ſhew you when ſinne is come to the full bigneſſe, and that it may be diſcovered by two things. The firſt is this, when ſinne is growne univerſall, and common, and generall, ſo that corruption is as it were crept into every corner and coaſt of the Nation, nay, it accompa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nieth every ſort and condition of men, in every place, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry village and towne: I muſt confeſſe, that amongſt a world of people ſome there will be, that will keepe their garments unſpotted, and themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled from the courſes of the wicked, but this is not the meaning of the point: but ſinne is ſaid to be generall, when the face of a Church and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is over-ſpread with baſe abominations, though ſome particulars be preſerved, and ſome few keepe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19631:74"/> themſelves unſpotted there with, what is that to the maine, what is a handfull to the multitude, what is one family to a towne, or one in a family, or one ſtreete in a citie? When ſinne overwhelmes the whole face and courſe of the Church: when for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, almoſt all ſorts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men depart from the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.23. this we ſhall obſerve is the very note that haſtens deſolation and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the bigneſſe of ſinne: All fleſh had corrupted their wayes, and God ſaw that the earth was full of violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here is univerſall inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, prophaneneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all fleſh had corrupted their wayes, all kindes of men, great ones, poore ones, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ones, baſe ones, all in all places and conditions, they all runne in the ſtreame of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19631:74"/> therefore marke in the 6. Verſe, the Text ſaith, <hi>It grieved the Lord at the heart that he had made man;</hi> God was inwardly vexed with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then hee begins to make an end, a Deluge of ſinne, and a Deludge of deſtruction, a ſloud of wickedneſſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the old world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the waters drowned the old world: Looke as it is with a Garden, if all the good fruite and herbes be ſpoiled, onely here and there a roote of an herbe, but all the reſt is like a wilderneſſe, then it is time to digge up the ground; ſo when wickedneſſe in a Land is growne like a wilderneſſe, drunkennes and ſwearing, like a wilderneſſe, here and there is a Saint of God and a poore ſoule, that walkes in ſincerity, but for the common, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſort deny the power of godlineſſe; when it is come to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19631:75"/> this paſſe, this is the time for deſolation and ruine; goe to and fro through the ſtreetes of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſee if there be any that doth righteouſneſſe; it was a ſtrange deſolation of righteouſneſſe, (as if the Lord had ſaid, goe from towne to towne, and ſee if there be any Magiſtrate abiding, or any Churchwardens abiding, and marke, he goeth to the poore, and they know not the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, then he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the rich, and they know it, but they breake all bonds. Now marke what the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <hi>Therefore a Lyon out of the forreſt ſhall ſlay them, and a Wolfe of the evening ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure them, becauſe rich and poore and all were backeſliders,</hi> the Lord beſet them with plagues, with Lyons and Beares, and Wolves, that is, ravenous enemies ſhall rend and teare them in peeces and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19631:75"/> none ſhall deliver: As it is in a man, if all the bloud &amp; ſpirits be infected, if the ſubſtantial parts, the head, the heart, &amp; the liver be conſuming and rotting, there muſt follow a totall ruine of the whole man, becauſe there is an univerſall kinde of corruption. Looke as it is in the building of an houſe, when the maine pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars begin to rot, &amp; the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the houſe moulder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there is no ſupporting of it, but it muſt be made new, or elſe it will fall down; as it is in the body naturall, ſo alſo in the body politique, as in the houſe, ſo in the eſtate, when there is a kinde of rottenneſſe in the body and eſtates, when the head is ſicke, and the heart heavie; <hi>When the children ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtickes, and the father kindles a fire, and the mother bakes cakes to the Queene of heaven:</hi> this is when young and old, and all conſpire together in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19631:76"/> the Lord ſendeth fire from heaven &amp; none ſhall quench it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.18. they all were buſie to performe idolatrous worſhip, father and mother, children and all, and ſaith the Lord, <hi>Doe they provoke me to anger, &amp; not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the confuſion of their owne faces:</hi> ſo it is when the husband and the wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all ſweare; when the father and mother hates holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Lord will ſend fire from heaven, and none ſhall quench it, iniquitie ſwells and groweth bigge in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the bigneſſe of ſin is diſcovered, when with the commonneſſe of ſinne, there is openneſſe joyned, when ſinne growes open, and ſhameleſſe, when the practiſers thereof become bold and baſe in their abhominable practiſes: Looke as it is with a graft, when it is little it cannot be perceived, the hedge or pale may hide it, but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19631:76"/> when it is growne, it overtops the pale and wall, and every man may perceive it; for when ſinne is committed onely by a few, when it is confined into a Cottage, or into an Houſe, then it is not ſo open to the view, but when all ſorts are given to it, the ſinne comes to have a whores forhead, and a braſen face; ſinners are more bold to oppoſe governors that are in place to puniſh it, then they are to execute the law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: drunkenneſſe was wont to be a rare thing, as one ſpake, drunkenneſſe was for Beggers, but now it is for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Knights: this ſhewes, that now ſinne is open and ſhameleſſe, and therefore that it is come to its full big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore wee may juſtly expect deſolation. But in the next place you will ſay, how ſhall wee know when ſin is come to the full ſtrength, I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19631:77"/> anſwer, looke as it is grace, ſo it is in ſinne: when a man can undergoe all trials, and beare up himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations and doubtings, when hee can either recover himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falne, or elſe keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this is an undoubted ſigne of a perfect and ſtrong Chriſtian: ſo it is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſinne, in the body of ſinne; in this old man of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, when a ſinner is come to this paſſe, that he is able by the power of his corruptions to withſtand all the meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming and reformation, when hee is not bettered by them, nor cannot be wrought upon by the power of them, then hee is a ſtrong wicked man, hee is one of the elſe ſonnes of Satan: hee is one of the generalls of the field in the campe of the devill; when all the helpes that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19631:77"/> and all the meanes that God hath ordained for the ſubduing of baſe corruptions, yet if the ſinnes that are in a family, or towne, or Nation, if the ſtreame and tide of them beare downe all before them, the worke of the Magiſtracie and Miniſtery, and meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, then it is a ſigne, that ſinne is come to the full ſtrength, and that ruine and deſolation ſhall befall that perſon, or family, or towne, or nation, when ſinne is come to that perfection, as it is in the body of a man, when a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene is ſpread ſo farre that nothing can ſtoppe it, no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke can remove it, it preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the certaine ruine of that man, that member muſt be cut off, or elſe the body will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: ſo when ſinne is growne ſo remedileſſe, that all the meanes which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the purging out of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19631:78"/> ſame will not prevaile, then it is a ſigne that ſinne is come to the full ſtrength, and that ſuch a nation or perſon is fit for ruine. But you will ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth this ſtrength of ſin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the oppoſing the means of reformation: I anſwer, it appeares, in five particulars; The firſt is this, when a Nation or People doth not profit by all the corrections that God layes upon them, when the rodde and blowes wherewith God hath exerciſed them have not proper and powerfull effects in the hearts of thoſe that have beene beaten mightily by the hand of God, when the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Lord, humble not a People, and reforme not a Nation, purge not the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſubdue not their diſtempers, nor make them come home to him that ſmote them, this argues the ſtrength of corruption, when the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19631:78"/> indignation of the Lord is not able to cruſh a proud drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, howſoever the Lord hath ſent many plagues into this country, and into this towne, here one is dying and there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is taken away by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angell of the Lord, yet is not his drunkenneſſe any whit abated, that man will be as drunke and proud, and as ſcorning, and as contemning of God &amp; his ordinances as ever: Thinke of it, the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will require it one day at your hands, when men will not be bettered by Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, hee will breake them in peeces; this is the courſe that God takes with them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.24. the Famine hath beene threatned, the plague inflicted and the Sword is comming, when your husbands went to racke then you were howling and crying, if the Sword come to plucke away the child out of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19631:79"/> the mothers armes, then there will be howling and taking notice of the abomination that harbours among you: if all the former judgements doe it not, hee will ſend the Sword, and there are ſeven plagues in a Sword; hee hath a quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all profane perſons that hate godlineſſe: God will be revenged upon the heads and hearts of them in that day, when hee ſendeth to viſite them. Looke as it is with a Goldſmith, if he have a veſſell or any peece in that nature that is all battered or broken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or if there be a cracke in it, that all the ſcowring and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of it will not bring it out, then hee will melt it; ſo when the canker of a baſe heart, this cankar of pride and covetouſneſſe, when theſe eate into the hearts of a company of ſinfull creatures, hee hammers them, hee ſends plagues and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19631:79"/> ſickneſſes, but if all this will not doe it, then hee will melt them, and deſtroy their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed generation and raiſe a new building that will walke with more care and conſcience, and be ſubject with more upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to take his yoke upon them, and if the Lord ſhould not proceed after this manner, God could not maintaine his owne glory and Iuſtice: if a company of wretches might ſcoffe at the corrections of the Lord, and count them as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of nothing they will brave the Almighty, let God doe what he can, wee will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and carnall, and unjuſt, let God plague us, wee will be more vicious than God can be angry with us, and execute plagues upon us: when it is thus with wicked men, the Lord will make them feele his fingers, and they that will not be amended, the Lord will
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19631:80"/> knocke them to peeces and conſume them. And when we ſhall ſee the ſtreets runne with the bloud of drunkards and looſe perſons, then you will ſay, had the hand of the Lord wrought upon us, it would not now have beene thus with us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.13. the Lord ſmote the people and they returned not, therefore what ſaith the Lord, he will plague and make an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of them, becauſe they would not humble themſelves before the Lord, nor ſeeke to him, nor make their peace with him, the Lord hath ſeven plagues more, and he will wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you in your bloud, and plucke your curſed abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from your boſomes, then you will ſay. God is juſt and terrible, and had wee beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by former puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wee had not hence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this fierce rodde which we now feele.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:19631:80"/>
            <p>The ſecond ſigne of the ſtrength of ſinne is this, when the Lord ſends peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and proſperitie, and theſe bleſſings of God doe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to love him ſo much the more, and uſe them ſo much the better, but they fall in love with the gift, and for<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake the giver; you make your honour, and eaſe, and pleaſure, you make them gods, and depart from the Lord, which is the giver of all, then it is juſt with the Lord to plucke away that eaſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and preferment that you dote upon, and are addicted to, that in the want of theſe, you may learne to prize the Goſpel, and learne to eſteeme of the Lord Chriſt and his grace above all theſe contents the world can afford: now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord ſhould be acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the diſhonour of his owne name, what would you
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19631:81"/> have the Lord to doe, would you have him give you peace and proſperitie, to neglect the peace of a good conſcience; by this meanes God ſhould be as it were, the author of his owne diſhonour: no, no, thinke of it; I feare it will be true, if the Lord ſhould take away our eaſe and liberty, that we have made Idols off, then you ſhall ſay, if you had prized God and Goſpel more than eaſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, you might have had theſe and God and Goſpel too, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.48. this is that which will one day ſticke heavie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts; for your ſoules ſake thinke of it, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; if the Lord ſhould ſend the enemy upon us, and lay hardneſſe over us, and wee ſhould be made vaſſals unto the tyranny of wicked men, this will ſticke to your hearts: had I ſerved the Lord in plenty, and ſuch a time when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19631:81"/> the meanes of ſalvation, then it had beene well with me, but I was looſe and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lords day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt now, I ſerve the enemie upon the Lords day, I am made a drudge and a vaſſall and a ſlave to the malice of the wicked. It is juſt with God and righteous with the Lord, you would not ſerve God when time was; you would not heare the Word when time was, God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a courſe for you, you ſhall have ſervice enough, and God will hold you to it, you ſhall ſerve cruell and bloud-thirſty enemies, to the ſhame of your faces here, and to the ruine of you and yours hereafter for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.21. then ſhall the land reſt one Sabbath, ſaith the Text: marke this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes; the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed every ſeventh yeare to be a Sabbath, that the Saints
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19631:82"/> ſhould reſt, there ſhould be no plowing nor ſowing and all creatures ſhould reſt; now they were ſo covetous that they would plucke commonly out of the earth, the ſeventh yeare, well ſaith the Lord, you will not let the land reſt, you ſhall be led captive, and then the land ſhall reſt on her Sabboth; it is juſt that God ſhould plucke away theſe benefits, to the confuſion of our face, for ever when we abuſe them. Looke as it is with a wife, if ſhe ſhould have a ſervant in the houſe which ſhee loves more than her husband, what courſe muſt be taken, hee muſt fling him out of the houſe and away with him; ſo when wee ſhould love God and prize his glory and truth, I, yet we will love the world, and profit, and eaſe, and quiet, and peace, and liberty, and we wil do nothing that may hazard theſe: it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19631:82"/> righteous with the Lord to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhere thoſe commodities, and plucke away the adulterous lover of wealth and honour and eaſe, that he may make a way himſelfe in your ſoules, that he may rule in you, and take poſſeſſion of you.</p>
            <p>The third meanes is this, when corrections reforme not, and the bleſſings of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade not men, then the Lord vouchſafeth to ſend his Word among his people, and that ſhould ſupply the want of all other meanes, and ſhould be more powerfull than any other in the world beſides, ſo that howſoever the covetous Carle dotes upon his wealth, the Word ſhould looſen his mind from it, and reveale the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it; however corrections humble not, yet the Word is able to breake the ſoule, and worke the ſoule to an humble ſubjection, the Word is the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19631:83"/> power of God to ſalvation, which is able to cruſh all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſubdue all ſinnes, but ſinne is come to this height that the Word is unfruitfull and unprofitable, then ſinne is deſperately ſtrong, and wee are then come to the laſt and worſt eſtate that can be, it is more than wee are aware of, and more than commonly wee conſider of, we know not what we doe, when our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in reſiſting the Word of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. It is a deadly ſigne of deſolation of any people: When the liberty of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was at the laſt gaſpe, giving up the Ghoſt, and there was but an inch between them and deſolation, marke what the Text ſaith, they mocked his Prophets, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed his Meſſengers, till the wrath of the Lord aroſe, and there was no remedy, here was the ground, this was the maine
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19631:83"/> thing, that the ſinne eates the eſtate in ſunder, and pulled downe the pillars of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Iudea,</hi> you would thinke, was it ſo much to deſpiſe the Word of a Miniſter, <hi>Ah,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>the wrath of the Lord aroſe and there was no remedy;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, the Lord is able to beare much at the hands of ungodly men: and me thinkes the Lord ſaith; I could have endured your drunkenneſſe, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your profaneſſe, had you but ſubmitted to my Word, thoſe corruptions might have beene ſubdued, but not onely to practiſe ungodlineſſe, but to refuſe the word, that ſhould ſubdue thoſe corruptions: when the Lord ſaw this, his wrath aroſe, and there was no remedy, God can endure much, though a man have many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in him, though many ſinnes have beene committed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19631:84"/> by him if the ſoule be yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to heare and tremble at Gods Ordinances, but when a man is not content to commit ſinne onely, but he will oppoſe Gods Word: then the Lord, like the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> can hold no longer, then the wrath of the Lord aroſe, and there was no remedy, but he would lay waſte the Land, when wee ſpill the phyſicke that ſhould cure us, and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſalve that ſhould heale us, how can we be helped and cured, this is the ground and reaſon of thoſe many phraſes we have in Scripture: Why? the Lord is ſaid to extend his providence over a people, in vouchſafing the Goſpell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. the later end; it is a well knowne place, wee will open it a little and apply it to our purpoſe, becauſe it is pregnant: the Text ſaith, <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, how often would I have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19631:84"/> gathered thee under my wings</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpell, and revealing of their ſinnes, he would have gathered their hearts unto him, and would have caſt the wing of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over a people, as they are willing to ſubmit to the Goſpell, but <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> would not, hee ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to reveale his will, they ſtoned them, therefore ſaith the Text, <hi>Your habitation is left unto you deſolute,</hi> that is the iſſue, they would not have the Word reforme them, therefore they ſhall have the Sword to plague them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.44. the caſe is evident, the Lord diſcovers the beſiedging and the ſacking of <hi>Ieruſalem, there ſhall not a ſtone be left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtone, becauſe thou knowest not the time of thy viſitation;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the Lord came to viſite <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with mercy to comfort her, with pardon to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19631:85"/> cheere her, to ſhew her her ſins, &amp; humble her ſoule, but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not this kindnes of the Lord, therefore there is a ſiege about her, and that is very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and take notice of it. The Lord is ſpecially angry with a Nation, for the breach of his Covenant, and neglect of his worſhip, the Lord doth hate it, and is carried with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards thoſe people that worſhip God falſely, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. the two laſt Verſes, the Text ſaith, <hi>He made of the loweſt of the people Prieſts:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, he made a company of drunkards, and belly-Gods Miniſters, and is that ſuch a great matter? Yes, that one ſin turned to the utter ruine of the houſe of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> to roote him out.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if this will not doe the deede, but men will reſiſt the meanes that God puts into their hands: then fourthly, this is an other evidence, that ſinne
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19631:85"/> groweth ſtrong when there wants a competent number of mourners in a land, which might uphold it, and joyne ſides againſt ſinne and Satan, and maintaine the good of a kingdome, in deſpight of the wicked in a kingdome, this is one of the laſt ſuccours of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a kingdome hath, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wicked men will not be perſwaded and humbled, yet if there be a competent number. if there be ſo many as will make an army of faſting and prayer to grapple with God, they may prevaile with God for mercy for a kingdome, there is hope though the moſt be naught, yet the better ſide will prevaile, but when the flouds of iniquitie ſlow in amaine, ſo that the beſt of Gods people are taken aſide with the ſtreame of corruption, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to grow careleſſe, and not to oppoſe the ſinnes of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19631:86"/> times, this is a ſore argument that there is almoſt no remedie for ſuch a Nation, no meanes to beate backe the indignation of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19 when <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> could not ſave it ſelfe, ten righteous perſons would have ſaved it, though they wold have pulled Gods indignation upon them, yet a competent number often men would have ſtayed the indignation, and gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the living and the dead; ſo were there a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable number of mourners in a Land, though there be a company of mocke-gods, that would pull downe the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God upon them, yet a company of godly gracious men might ſtrive with the Lord, and uphold their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but when corruptions are growne ſo ſtrong that good men are defiled, and their hearts tainted, and their mouthes ſtopped, woe to that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19631:86"/> kingdome and people: Looke as it is with the ſea-coaſt, when the bankes are ſuch that they can beare out the waves, be the ſea never ſo boyſterous, there is hope of ſafetie, but if the ſea breake all before it, there is no hope to ſtoppe it, ſo it is in this caſe, the bankes that beare out the indignation of the Lord, are righteous holy men, they ſtay the hand of God, and ſtop the floud of Gods vengeance; that they doe not breake in and overflow all, but if the banke be gone, if a convenient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of godly men be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then there is no hope of mercy, but the ſea of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation will flow in amaine upon that place.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt meanes, to uphold liberty and ſafetie of a Nation, is this when men begin to be ſenſible of miſery, when they have eyes to ſee the plague, and hearts affected
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19631:87"/> with the ſinnes committed, and with the judgements deſerved when they obſerve what will befall, they will uſe ſome meanes that it may not befall: but when a people grow ſenſeleſſe, and benummed, and ſecure, in a baſe practiſe and ungodly courſe, that they obſerve not the evills committed, nor take notice of the judgements of God deſerved, but lie in a careleſſe ſecure condition, there is no expectation in reaſon how ſuch a Nation ſhould prevent the wrath of the Almighty, when they ſee not what ſhall befall, have no care to prevent what may befall, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.3. There is a warning ſhot before the Cannon ſhot, there is a watch word before deſtruction commeth, when they crie peace, then commeth deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on: when they quiet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their owne courſes-
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19631:87"/> when they are not onely wicked, but ſecure in their wickedneſſe, then comes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine deſtruction, I conclude with that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.39. As it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> there the Lord as it were ſmites men with Plagues anſwerable to their ſinnes, they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſecure in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and then came ſuddaine deſtruction, ſo it will be now, as in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> when <hi>Noah,</hi> was knocking the Arke, every naile hee drave, was a Sermon: Repent you carnall and unjuſt oppreſſors, the flood is comming and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion approaching, but they knew nothing, that is, they feared no ſuch matter: Let <hi>N<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wee will now make uſe of the point, the caſe is cleare, when ſinne outbids all meanes of reformation, then men are ripe for deſolation, wee will firſt raiſe a ground of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then make way for an uſe of examination, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19631:88"/> learne this point of inſtruction, that this, of all plagues under heaven, is one of the heavieſt of all judgements, it is the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that a wicked man ſhould proſper and thrive in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly courſes, that hee ſhould bee able to breake through the net, and come off clearely; whatſoever comes to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he hath what hee will, and doth what hee pleaſe, and no word reformes him, no meanes hinder him, thinke of this when the Lord pulls up the ſtake, and gives him the reine, and lets him goe poſt-haſte, and hurry headlong downe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that is the onely way to pull the ſoule of a ſinner into the bottomleſſe pit. It is ſaid, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. that when the Lord doth pleaſe to bring any of his people home, this is Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care in the ſixt Verſe, the Lord prickes his fingers, and ſtops him, and makes a hedge
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19631:89"/> about a covetous deceitfull wretch, that he cannot breake through but hee hath now a knocke of conſcience, now a judgement of God, now a terrour of the Almighty. This is the onely way to bring a ſoule home to God, then ſhee will ſay, <hi>I will returne unto my firſt husband,</hi> but this is one of the heavieſt judgements, and ſoreſt plagues that can befall a ſinfull creature, that the Lord ſhould pull downe the hedge, and breake open the wall, and let them runne ryot, take thy courſe, and follow thy vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I will hinder thee no more till I have thee in hell, and then thou ſhalt be plagued for all together, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.3. it is a fine phraſe, when <hi>Jeremie</hi> was perplexed with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the wicked, he was marvelouſly troubled, becauſe of the excellency of ungodly men, at laſt hee quits himſelfe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19631:89"/> with this, <hi>they were as Sheepe fatted for the ſlaughter.</hi> What will become of you that have all meanes of reformation, the Lords mercies and Miniſters, and judgements have ſtriven with you; what will become of you when ſuch a creature comes to hell, the divell will make bonefires of him, but they ſhall make holy day in hell, their plagues ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to theirs that have had all meanes, and reſiſted all meanes of grace and ſalvation, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells will rejoyce to meete a drunkard in hell, and ſay, what art thou come to hell, after all meanes vouchſafed, and all helpes beſtowed? the divells will make bonefires, and ſtand on tip-toes and crow over ſuch perſons.

            <p>The ſecond uſe is a uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, Is this true then, when ſinne growes ripe, then the Lord will not ſuccour and relieve any more, then wee may have a ſhrowd gueſſe, and gather a ſoare argument of the

Secondly it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that among 176. verſes there is not above one or two
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19631:92"/> but mentioneth the Law of God, either Law, or Precepts, or Commandements, or Word, or Statutes, Teſtimonies or the like, as if the Prophet <hi>David</hi> had beſtowed himſelfe wholly, and had beene eaten up with the Law of God. The ayme of the Text is to diſcover the great deſire that the holy <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> hath, and expreſſeth to God for the removall of the body of ſinne that was upon him, and for the ſupply of that grace he ſtood in neede of, and craved at the hands of the Lord, and the two parts of <hi>David,</hi> prayer are the two parts of the Text; the firſt is the evill that hee would have removed from him, firſt, <hi>take from mee the way of lying,</hi> the ſecond is the great good hee needs, and begs and craves to be beſtowed, upon him, <hi>grant mee thy Law gratiouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former againe take
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19631:93"/> notice of two things, the firſt is the nature of the ſinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and it is tearmed <hi>the way of lying.</hi> The ſecond is the affection <hi>David</hi> had to this ſinne, he was weary of it, and burthened with it, &amp; was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have it removed from him, take it from me, and not onely take it, but cauſe it to goe away, as the Hebrew phraſe carries it, it implyes an action upon an action, as the Hebrew expreſſeth it, if the way of lying will not goe, Lord take it away from the ſoule of thy ſervant; wee will firſt come to the firſt part, and paſſe breefely, becauſe it is not the maine thing wee intend, but what is meant here by the word <hi>way?</hi> Wee muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the paſſages of a mans Spirit, and the practices of a mans life and converſation are ſaid in Scripture to bee a path or way, it is compared to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19631:93"/> a path way, when all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and abilitie of a ſinner is ſpent in travelling and paſſing from one duty to another, from one action and ſervice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the body paſſeth from place to place, ſo the ſoule of a man goeth from one ſervice to another, ſo that the worke of a man, whether touching the ſoule or his outward actions, they are ſayd to be a mans way; the minde is plotting and the affections ſtirring, and the will chooſing, and all the parts of the body are acting forth their ſeverall workes, this is a way, this the Prophet <hi>David</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young man clenſe his wayes?</hi> that is the frame of his heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and his converſation outwardly, and the motions of the heart, and thoughts of the minde they are the galleries within doores, and all a mans courſes and carriages and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19631:94"/> are the rodes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roomes, ſo that by the way is meant nothing but the curſed diſtemper of a mans heart, and the diſorder of his life; the corruption of a man in regard of his diſpoſition inwardly, and his actions outwardly, that is the <hi>way</hi> the Prophet here mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <p>Now the point wee are to treate on is this; the nature of all ſinne is to be deceitfull, the courſe of corruption is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it is faire in the outſide, but in the bottome it will cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and delude; all the wayes of ſinne are crooked, and all the wayes of wickedneſſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, it is the nature of all ſinne in generall, and of every ſinne in particular to bee counterfeit and deceitfull, this the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Put off the old man</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>that is corrupt after his deceitfull luſts,</hi> the luſts of a mans heart
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19631:94"/> will tell him hee lies to his face.</p>
            <p>Now the deceit of ſinne is double, firſt it makes a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, corruption in the heart is like rottenneſſe in the roote of a tree, or in the coare of an Apple, it withers all the branches if the roote be rotten, and if the coare of an Apple be rotten, though it bee never ſo beautifull, it will deceive him that buyeth it, it will not bee fit for foode to him that hath it; ſo rottenneſſe in the heart and diſtempers in the ſoule, it will wither all the ſhewes of equity, and honeſty, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, that formerly were obſerved, <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, it is deceitfull, not onely becauſe it deceives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but it deceives the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe, as it makes the ſinner deceive others, ſo it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the ſinner, it promiſes faire, and performes nothing in concluſion, it hath a faire outſide, but the iſſue is nothing at all, it promiſeth mountaines of riches and eaſe, but when a man lies on his death bed, it plagues the ſoule and rends the heart, <hi>Obad.</hi> 3.

I will name onely this, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to trade with the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee calls his Councell, <hi>Let us deale wiſely,</hi> he thought all the world was his now, but when hee thought to deale
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19631:96"/> wiſely, his wiſedome couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, for take notice of it, which is a thing remarkeable, the way he tooke to ſuppreſſe them did multiply them, for hard labour is the onely way for generation and multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his putting of them to great paines, turned to deceit to himſelfe: ſo then if ſinne promiſe faire to others, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth what it pretends; if it promiſe faire to the workers thereof and never performes it, then ſinne is deceitfull, ſinne is a lyer: you might ſave mee a labour, then me thinkes every man that underſtands himſelfe, and hath common ſence will make the ſence and concluſion faire, never beleeve a lyer, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience teacheth us this; no man will place his confidence in a diſſembler that will couzen him: this will be the iſſue of all ungodly courſes; you that looke after and attend

So ſinne will ſpeake thus of it ſelfe, and ſay, can a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19631:97"/> holy converſation, a Chriſtian way, an exact life, can theſe procure pleaſure, and caſe and credit; nay, is it poſſible they ſhould procure any content in this world: Iudge but equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indifferently in this caſe, and marke how every luſt will pleade for it ſelfe. Whether is it more likely ſaith flattering and time-ſerving, that friends and great meanes which I will bring with me, or perſecution, and oppoſition, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wil attend a holy courſe, whether more like to inrich you; and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaith, whether will great living and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a priſon which exactneſſe and curioſitie hath accompaning of it, whether is more likely to advance you? and impatience ſaith is like to right your wrongs, you have hard dealing and meaſure, if you will be ruled by me, I will revenge all, but if you bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19631:98"/> by patience and meekneſſe you muſt beare all, whether is like to right your wrongs? and this is the reaſon that one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes revenge, and another malice, and thinkes to give himſelfe full content, ſtop your eares, and fence your hearts, againſt theſe chanting charmes of ſinne and Sathan, beleeve not one ſentence or ſillable, they will all deceive you, they will pretend faire, but the iſſue and event will not bee anſwerable in any meaſure. Alas what is it for a man to drinke a draught of poyſon in a golden cup and die as ſoone as hee hath done? what is it to bee rich and a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>probate, honored and damned? what is it for a man to pull vengence upon his brother, and to pull everlaſting deſtruction upon his ſoule, theſe are lyars and will deceive you, for the Lords ſake therefore never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon and truſt thereunto,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19631:98"/> and bring experience from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times of the old deceits of ſinne, and caſt diſparagement in the face of theſe pleas, and ſtoppe the mouth of theſe ſinnes, and tell ambition, is this your honour, with <hi>Haman</hi> to be in high regard to day and hanged to morrow? then let me be meane ſtill, is this all the content that all the carnall meanes in the world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, to fare deliciouſly every day with <hi>Dives,</hi> and then lie in hell for ever? Let mee live poorely rather; this will ſtoppe the mouth of theſe pleas; if a man have experience of an old cheater, if a man be noted, and have beene on the Pillery for his cheating, no man will truſt him, he couzens and deceives all that ever hee deales withall, have nothing to do with ſinne, it is an old Cheater, an old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, there was never any that truſted thereunto, or had
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19631:99"/> dealing therewith, but was couzened and deluded, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as they ſaid, <hi>What have we to doe with Idols?</hi> So ſay you, what have I to doe with pride, and malice, and envie, and earthly mindedneſſe, and carnall ſecuritie? they are all deceivers and cheaters: this they ſerved ſuch a one, and ſuch a one, therefore I will have nothing to doe with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10. the Text ſaith, <hi>Truſt not in oppreſſion</hi> becauſe the oppreſſour hath a weightie purſe, and great friends and meanes, he thinkes to carry all before him, but truſt not in oppreſſion, for it will deceive you, ſo truſt not to a proud heart, truſt not to a malicious heart, in concluſion it will leave you in the duſt, when you looke for conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you ſhall ſee nothing but miſery and confuſion, gall of conſcience here, and the

            <p>Secondly, as wee muſt be carefull not to truſt a Lyar, and depend upon a Cheater, ſo we muſt be carefull to warne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of ſinne; this humanity learnes us, and reaſon will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man to this, if hee hath eſcaped robbing by the highway, he tells every paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, take heede how you paſſe by ſuch a place leaſt you are ſurprized: if a man hath taken a Cheater, hee will bid every man have a watchfull eye to the cut-purſe leſt he be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; much more ought wee to have a care of the ſoules of our brethren, you that have heretofore found by woefull experience the trechery of ſin; a proud heart hath cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened you, and a looſe heart hath deceived you, when you are delivered and freed from theſe ſpoylers and robbers in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19631:100"/> this nature, leave a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to your fellow bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as is is ſaid of <hi>Lots</hi> wife, <hi>Remember Lots wife;</hi> her han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after <hi>Sodom</hi> brought her confuſion; remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife, and bold proud wives and ſervants, take heede of a proud heart, I was deceived with it, take heede of a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, I was cozened with it, take heede of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous heart, I had like to have beene overthrowne with it, if the Lord had not beene merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I had never beene delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 2. The place is excellent, take heede, ſaith the Apoſtle, leſt you alſo fall ſhort, and as if he had ſaid, you that live in the boſome of the Church, and enjoy the meanes of grace and ſalvation, you thinke you muſt needs goe to heaven: take heede this cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened ſixtie hundred thouſand fighting men in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19631:100"/> they were deceived and ruinated, &amp; it ſlew them; take you heede therefore, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their dead carcaſſes, and beware you, leaſt you truſt wholly to the meanes, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the meanes, not truſting to God, and relying upon him for your everlaſting comfort: and it is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> leaves upon record, as a point in his owne experience, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 8. ſpeaking there of truſting to mans carnall confidence, if any man could boaſt of this, and that, ſaith he, then much more I, <hi>I am an Hebrew of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, and circumciſed the eight day;</hi> and if any man may boaſt, if any man have cauſe to truſt upon theſe carnall proppes, I have more than any man, but they leave me in the lurch, and that which I counted gaine, it proved loſſe; as who ſhould ſay, you that live, remember this, I thought to be ſaved by
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19631:101"/> my priviledges, and I truſted to my performances, I thought none ſhould goe to heaven, if not learned <hi>Paul,</hi> and judicious <hi>Paul,</hi> and experienced <hi>Paul,</hi> but theſe left me in the lurch in concluſion, therefore take heed that you truſt not thereunto.</p>
            <p>Wee come now to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the holy man had to this ſinfull diſtemper in this nature, the Text ſaith, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from me the way of lying, take it away,</hi> that is the phraſe, <hi>I will doe what I can Lord, and doe thou what I cannot, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is take it away from my ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Point is this, <hi>A good heart is in good earneſt content to part with any corruption:</hi> What <hi>David</hi> did, a good man muſt doe, the ground is the ſame, and the worke of grace is the ſame, a good heart is in good earneſt content to part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruption, he doth not put
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19631:101"/> off God with good words, and thinke to ſatisfie God with faire ſpeeches, but it is ſeriouſly and ſadly, and in good earneſt content to part with any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: Hee doth not ſay Lord, take away ſome ſtile out of the way, or take away ſome logge or impediment in the way of ſinning, I would not be diſparaged and diſgraced and troubled in ſinning, no Lord, take away the way of ſinning, that I may never walke in that way more: this was the guiſe of the ſoule of the holy man; and it is ſo with every holy man, and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. and it was ſo with the converted Church, when their hearts were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and they came to ſeeke the Lord, they ſay, take away from us all our iniquitie, and receive us graciouſly: they doe not halfe it with God and patch it, and peece-meale it; but oh take away all iniquitie,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19631:102"/> even the greateſt and the leaſt and the deareſt, take away all Lord, not onely the open and the knowne, but the ſecret and the hidden, Lord take away all iniquitie, and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly: In the old Law the burnt offering was all to be burnt; ſo is it with a ſound heart, when it offers a whole burnt offering to the Lord of ſinne, leave not a haire or a hoofe behind, but let all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and all over-maſtered, and ſubdued: ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.133. <hi>Let not any iniquitie have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over thy ſervant;</hi> marke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the generalitie, there is none exempted, none reſerved, there is no reſervation, not one Lord <hi>Let no ſinne have dominion over me.</hi> A good heart will not deale with ſinne as the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> dealt with the <hi>Cananites,</hi> the Lord commanded them to drive out the <hi>Cananites</hi> and leave none there, but they for
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19631:102"/> their owne profit would not deſtroy them utterly but made them tributaries, but a ſound haart will not thus deale with ſinne, he would have it utterly removed: it is a baſe thing that a man ſhould retribute from his ſinnes, he will not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all malice, but he will take tribute of malice, that hee may vexe thoſe he hath ſome ſecret ſpleene againſt, but this is the courſe, every man ſhould take up, we ſhould baniſh all ſinne, every <hi>Cananite,</hi> every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not onely not ſuffer it to dwell with us, but not to be among us; therefore looke what <hi>Haman</hi> did againſt <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay,</hi> hee was not content to kill <hi>Mordecay</hi> alone, but hee hated the whole Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> therefore hee would be at the charge to diſpatch the whole nation; let but the King ſend out his decree, and hee would be at the charge for the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19631:103"/> deſtroying of the Iewes, this ſhewes the malice of the man; ſo it might be with our malice againſt ſinne, a man muſt not onely hate a baſe beggerly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a poore <hi>Mordecay</hi> that will not profit, but the whole nation of corruption abandon that, God hath given out his warrant againſt every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore be thou at the charge to execute it, and ſet thy ſelfe againſt the whole nation of rebellion of heart, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of ſpirit; this ought to be the guiſe and frame of the ſoule. I have done with the proofe of the Point: we come now to open the Point; when I ſay the good heart is content to part with any corruption, this parting of ſinne and the ſoule appeare in two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: Firſt, hee labours and ſtrives and endeavours to doe what he can himſelfe; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he goes to God to doe that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19631:103"/> he is not able: firſt for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the endeavour and ſtrife of a ſinner, for the parting of his ſinne and his ſoule, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in foure particulars, in all which we may fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that in the ſoule of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, there is this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make a breach betweene his ſoule and his diſtempers: firſt, a ſound heart is ready to take the leaſt notice of any thing that is unlawfull, it hearkens to any information, that may diſcover any thing to be ſinnefull in any meaſure, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any manner; this is one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the ſoule is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to part with any ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is marvellous ready to heare any thing againſt ſinne that it might part there from; a man that doth ſeriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to remove another out of his poſſeſſion, the courſe whereby hee doth expreſſe his affection is this, he is ready to

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19631:104"/> and ſuch a practice unlawful, he is very carefull to attend, &amp; lay his heart levill thereunto; nay, if his enemy out of malice and ſpleene, and envie, ſhall caſt any thing upon him as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unlawfull, it mill make his heart ſhake within him, and he beginnes to conſider, I never thought ſuch a courſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſuch a practiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, I ſee ſuch a man dares not doe it, if it be a ſinne, why ſhould not I reforme it as well as another, and if it be not a ſinne, why ſhould he abridge himſelfe of that liberty which is lawfull, and the ſoule will never be quieted, till it get ſound information, what is lawfull, and may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and what is unlawfull, and ought to be avoided: this is an argument, that hee is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe hee is willing to know what is evill, that hee

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19631:105"/> what I know not teach thou me, if I have done iniquitie, I will doe it no more: a gracious heart when he cannot ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, will be ſuſpicious, what courſes are unlawfull, and will ſeeke direction from God, that he may clearely perceive it, and reforme it and avoid it: the heart of man is deceitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, therefore a good man when he hath ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched what he can, if hee heare of any tricke and device that a carnall hypocrite may have, he ſearcheth and ſeekes, am I ſuch a one? and hee lookes up to heaven, and ſaith, Lord thou knoweſt the heart, let mee know it, thou knoweſt the windings of this ſoule of mine, let me underſtand it that I may not be couzened.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this, when the ſound heart is informed of the ſinne with evidence of reaſon, it yeelds quietly, and ſits
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19631:106"/> downe convinced, and ſubmit it ſelfe to the authority of the power of the truth; this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, a gracious heart, as it will not when there is no reaſon to gainſay a truth, ſo it will not invent trickes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate the power of the truth when it is evident, and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought home to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is certaine, though a man out of a carnall minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fleſh will have his bouts, although a gracious heart ſometimes when it is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Reaſons are ſound, and Scriptures undeniable, it will a little quarrell and wrangle for the while: yet when it ſeeth it cannot anſwer the argument, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to embrace the reaſon and be framed thereby, and ſubmit to the rule thereof, <hi>Iob</hi> 40.4. when the Lord came to ſchoole <hi>Iob,</hi> and had informed him of his owne exellencie, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19631:106"/> his baſeneſſe, he yeelds up the bucklers preſently, once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer, yea twice, but I will proceed no further, as who ſhould ſay, I have ſpoken fooliſhly, and ſaid unadviſedly, but I will ſay it no more, and famous is that of the <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> woman, when Chriſt was hot upon her, and called her dogge, truth Lord ſaith ſhee, yet the dogges may eate of the crummes that fall from their maſters table as who ſhould ſay, I confeſſe I am as bad as thou ſpeakeſt, I deny not what I am, I am a dog I yeeld it, yet the dogges lye under the table, that is all I crave and aske, that I may lye under the table and waile for crummes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, you know how it was with <hi>Peter</hi> when he had denied our Saviour, he doth not wrangle it out &amp; colour it over, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry looke of our Saviour was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make him got out

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19631:107"/> though diſtempered; take hot water into a windy ſtomacke the winde will ſtirre on one ſide, and the water on another ſide, and diſtemper the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, but let the party take a little Methridate, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate cloſing with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke will eaſe a man, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh a man in this kinde: ſo a good man hath a weake judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this kinde, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a diſtempered heart, but when the good word of the Lord, the Cordiall water, the Methridate, when that comes into his minde, and is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſoule, a man will quarrell with profit and eaſe and carnall reaſon, but yet the ſoule will bee the better and will cloſe with it, for its everlaſting good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly when a ſound heart hath taken notice and is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and upon that informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſits downe convinced, then in the third place it will ſet it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19631:108"/> ſelfe immediatly to the duty whereof it is informed and convinced, when the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtands cleare, and the heart yeelds, the floodgate is ſet open, and the water will flow, if there were any evill before committed, the ſoule ſets upon the reformation of it, if any duty not before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it now ſets upon the performance thereof; conſider of it, it is true I doe not ſay that when a man is informed and convinced, what is the courſe God requires, and what is the duty God commands, a man can then doe the duty as hee ought, but hee will doe what he can, and labour for ability to doe that, which for the preſent he cannot, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22 3, it was a hard taske that God enjoyned <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſacrifice his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and darling ſonne <hi>Iſaack,</hi> now when the thing was plaine though it was never ſo
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19631:108"/> hard, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſet about it, he got up betimes in the morning, and he and the child went, and the ſervants and all, and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelfe to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duty, and hee prevents all occaſions that might hinder him, his wife was not acquainted with it, his ſervants knew nothing of the matter: ſo if a man be the ſonne of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lord commands it, though it bee the killing of a darling ſecure, tender, beloved luſt, if the Lord ſay it muſt bee done, this ſinne muſt bee abandoned, this corruption muſt bee refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, though it bee never ſo profitable, and bring never ſo much contentment; hee will riſe betimes in the morning, that is, hee will uſe all meanes, and imploy all helpes for the accompliſhing of it. A gracious heart if his minde be informed and his conſcience convinced
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19631:109"/> of a duty, he will ſet upon the duty, it is a thing I would have you remember, it is a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſtemper of Spirit, when people ſpeake thus, I confeſſe it is a thing that ought to bee avoyded, the word forbids it, the Lord condemnes it, and my conſcience goes againſt it, but what would you have me doe? I cannot ſet into the worke, I cannot goe on in the worke, why then lay all aſide, lay ſincerity aſide, for it cannot ſtand with ſinceritie, that I ſhould be informed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of a duty which the Lord requires at my hands, and I not ſet upon it. I doe not ſay a found heart will not doe it as he ought, but he will ſtrive to get abilitie to performe that God requires. Alas ſaith the Gallant I confeſſe theſe faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are fooleries, but what ſhall I doe out of faſhion with the world, the Text ſaith,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19631:109"/> 
               <hi>faſhion not your ſelves after the world,</hi> but the truth is I know not how to get out, and how to get in, it is a ſtrict paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, art thou informed of a duty and convinced of it, and is thy heart perſwaded of it, and wilt thou not ſet about it? where is grace then, Civli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will reforme, Hypocriſie will reforme, Nature will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, Reaſon will reforme a man in outward things, but if a man will not part with an apiſh faſhion, a foolery, how will he part with all ſinne, that will not part with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the appearance of ſinne? I conclude thus, he that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and convinced, what is ſin, and ought to be avoided, and will not addreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to reforme it, that man is not under the power of the Word and therefore hath no power of grace, but hee that knowes the Word of God
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19631:110"/> requires this, and that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts this, and is convinced of it, and will not ſubmit to that word, hee is not under the power of the Word, therefore hath no power of grace.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, as hee is willing to know what he ſhould doe, and is eaſily convinced of what he is informed, and doth endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to doe that whereof he is convinced: ſo in the laſt place his heart is content to take up the hardeſt meanes, the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt medicines, that God hath appointed for the killing and ſlaying of his corruptions, if there bee any medicine in the world more keene then other, any meanes more ſharpe then other that may cut off his baſe diſtempers, a gracious heart will be content to take up that, that it may ſerve his turne, that there might bee reformation made. I expreſſe it thus, take an arme or a legge that hath a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19631:110"/> Gangrene, the nature of the ſore is, that it will infect, and ſpread, and kill the whole man, now the Chirurgion comes and tells the patient, either you muſt loſe your legge, or your life, either you muſt have your arme cut off, or you will cut off your dayes, there is no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, why then if the patient ſay hee will abide the worſt, every man will ſay he doth not purpoſe to live; if he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to maintaine life, hee would take away that which will take away life: So it is here with ſome kinde of baſer ſinnes, I meane groſſer, opener notoriouſer crimes that I may ſo ſay are ſcandalouſly vile, there is no way in the world, but there muſt be ſome ſharpe corraſive applied, or elſe the ſoule will never bee ſeparated from theſe, there muſt be ſome ſtrong corraſive and ſharpe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine applied, now if the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19631:111"/> ſoule will not take that corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and medicine, he doth not purpoſe to part with ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee will not uſe the meanes that may take away ſinne; as for inſtance a man hath gotten an eſtate by thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie and couzenage and the like, now when the Word of God comes home to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and informes him, and tells him he muſt ſatisfie every man, that is the thing, he muſt make ſatisfaction, for hee ſhould humble himſelfe and bemoane his eſtate with teares, that will not ſerve the turne, nothing will cure him, but ſatisfaction that is the Gangrene that muſt be cut off, but then hee will ſay moſt of his eſtate was gotten by this meanes, and if hee make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction hee ſhall beggar him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but if hee bee content in good earneſt to part with his ſinnes, he will take this courſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19631:111"/> becauſe nothing elſe will doe the deed, a Broker in <hi>London</hi> that had gotten much by couzning, when the Word came home unto him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſinnes, hee was content to make ſatisfaction till it came to five and ten pound, but when it came to an hundred pound he flew off; I will paſſe no judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but his courſe was baſe before, and ſo it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, a man that deales falſely, this is the medicine this is the corraſive that muſt cure him, thus <hi>Zacheus</hi> did. If I have wronged any man ſaith he by forged cavelation, let him come I will reſtore him foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. A gracious heart that is truly wrought upon will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this medicine; the other inſtance is this, imagine a man that lives in the boſome of the Church, a great profeſſour hath beene either openly drunk,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19631:112"/> or hath beene a knowne adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, there is no cure for this man, let him faſt and pray, and humble his ſoule, and cry and howle, I know not how this mans conſcience can be quieted unleſſe he make publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the Congregation, hee muſt not onely ſatisfie his owne conſcience, but hee muſt ſatisfie the Congregation, the Church of God hath beene wronged, and the Church of Chriſt diſhonoured and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, hee muſt therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe publick pennance, as his offence was publicke, this is a ſharpe medicine, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſive, but a good heart will take it up, as an antient ſpake, hee lay at the Church doore and ſaid, ſpit upon me, caſt me out of your Congregation, ſo God caſt not my ſoule out of heaven I care not. Thus much a good heart will doe, and then he is content in good earneſt to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19631:112"/> part with his corruptions, hee is willing to know what is ſinne, he yeelds when hee is informed, and readily embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth what hee yeelds to, nay he will take the ſharpeſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to doe him good, but if yet the ſinner findes that hee cannot be rid of his corruptions and diſtempers, then he goeth to God, and intreats him to doe that for him which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe himſelfe, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in three things The firſt paſſage is this, it lookes unto the truth of God, and it wiſheth and welcomes thoſe truths that are in reaſon moſt powerfull to prevaile with his ſoule, and moſt likely to worke moſt effectually, for the ſubduing of his ſinnes, that when he cannot doe what hee would, and maſter his ſinnes as he deſires, he wiſheth that the Lord would direct ſome man by ſome powerfull truth to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19631:113"/> plucke theſe rebellions out of his ſoule, hee wiſheth and hee wellcomes, and he takes thoſe truths that may be powerfull and effectuall this way, ſo that the ſoule makes his moane to God and complaines as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>ye are too hard for mee yee ſonnes of Zerviah,</hi> Oh Lord, theſe corruptions ſticke too faſt, they are too ſtrong, they are too mighty for me, I am not able to remove them, but Lord, take them thou away from my ſoule, take away the way of iniquitie from me, nay, teare them from me, nay, doe what thou wilt with my ſoule, onely remove them from my my ſoule, this is a gracious heart now, nay, the Lord takes this as his proper worke and ſpeciall prerogative, I take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart of ſtone, and I give the heart of fleſh, this is his perogative royall, none meddles with it but he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19631:113"/> the ſoule argues thus, Lord, thou haſt ſaid, that thou takeſt away the heart of flint, thou haſt promiſed to ſubdue a ſtubbourne ſpirit, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a malicious vaine ſpirit, Lord doe this for the ſoule of thy ſervant, take away theſe diſtempers, and in thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, anſwer the deſires of the ſoule of thy ſervant, helpe me Lord againſt the rage of theſe ſinnefull diſtempers, and when the truth of Chriſt layes battery againſt a mans heart, and that it brings and ſets up another frame and diſpoſition of heart, the ſoule lies under the blow, and cloſeth with that truth, more of that Lord, oh there againe Lord. A man that is troubled with the toothach, if the Tooth-drawer apply his inſtrument, and hee find hee hath hold of it, hee ſaith, that is it, pull it out, leave nothing behind. So when the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19631:114"/> ſoule is under the ſtroake of ſtrong diſtemper, if hee make conſcience of theſe things, when the word comes home to his ſoule, and meetes with that diſtemper, he ſaith Lord, plucke out all of it, that I may never ſee that pride more that I may never ſee that malice more, leave not a ſtumpe behinde, Lord, that I may be freed from that curſed diſtemper of ſpirit, this is the difference betweene a varniſhed hypocrite, and a ſound heart, a wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart, it feares leaſt the Word ſhould come home to it, it feares the blow when hee ſeeth it comming, hee wiſheth he were ridde of the place, or the Miniſter ridde of that point; but a ſound heart feares leaſt the Word ſhould not come cloſe enough, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to it ſelfe, and knowes and ſees, I have heard ſuch Sermons, and ſuch terrors, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19631:114"/> ſuch mercies revealed, and I am ſtill to this day ſtubborne, to this day rebellious; ſo that I feare nothing will prevaile with mee, nothing will get ground againſt this rebellious ſpirit of mine, I feare the Word will not touch me, nor maſter this rebellious ſpirit, this is ſomewhat, you meane in good earneſt that you and your ſinne will part; it is a fine paſſage <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.6. One meetes him and askes him, where hadſt thou this wound? I was wounded in the houſe of my friend; a gracious heart counts the Miniſter a friendly Miniſter, and a friendly Word that cuts his heart to the quicke, and goeth to the coare of his corruptions, oh the wound was the wound of a friend, it was a friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, the Miniſter ſpake friendly to mee that wounded my corruptions, I ſaw the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19631:115"/> coare comming, why this is ſomewhat when the ſoule can wellcome ſuch truths, as are for the a wakening of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the ſoule wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and wellcomes thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular truths, that may awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and overpower a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and leave a contrary grace, ſo it is reſtleſſe before God be pleaſed for to worke this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſee every corruption maſtered, and the frame of ſinne tottered at a reſtleſly looking to God, and reſtleſly waiting upon God, why when will it once be? ſuch a mans heart is broken, and ſuch a mans conſcience awakened, and ſuch a mans ſpirit brought low, and Lord, ſhall nothing prevaile with me? He is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in ſeeking unto the Lord till he ſee every ſinne maſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, and every corruption o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowred, ſo that though it be inherent, yet it is not reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19631:115"/> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> man being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and fearefull, he never thinkes his enemy killed till he hath cut off his head, hee will be ſure to make him paſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; ſo a gracious heart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinkes his ſinnes are ſlaine, till hee ſee the ſtrength and power thereof ſubdued in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular more or leſſe, till hee ſee the very bloud and life of his corruptions remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this is that a gracious heart is reſtleſſe and intreats at Gods hand from day to day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a fine paſſage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death;</hi> marke the weight of his complaint, hee doth not ſay, deliver mee from the ſtroake of ſinne, or the action of ſinne, but from the body of ſinne, there is a body of pride, there is a body of malice, a body of anger, a body of the curſed diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19631:116"/> of a mans ſoule; now a gracious heart is not content to be freed onely from the tongue of pride, that hee may not ſpeake proudly, but Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver mee from the body of pride, from the body of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, from the inward frame of my diſtempers: in a word, looke what <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mordecay,</hi> when hee had all the cappes in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all knees bowing to him, <hi>What availeth this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſo long as I ſee Mordecay ſit in the Kings gate?</hi> So ſaith a gracious heart, what availes it me, that I am not a theefe, or a drunkard, or an adulterer, if yet this proud heart prevailes, this proud heart and carnall confidence of mine will bring my ſoule into everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the ſoule is reſtleſſe till the Lord looke upon him, and deliver him from his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:19631:116"/>
            <p>The third thing is this, that the ſoule is content that God ſhall doe what hee will with his corruptions, take them away after what manner hee pleaſe, though it bee upon the hardeſt tearmes in the world, as it welcomes thoſe truths that may worke, as it is reſtleſſe till they doe worke, ſo it is contented that the Lord ſhould worke upon ſinne, and ſubdue it upon the hardeſt tearmes in the world. A covetous man if nothing but beggery will loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen his heart from the world, then hee will pray the Lord to make him give away all, and leave himſelfe a beggar ſo hee may have a liberall heart: So if a man bee notable to ſubdue the pride of his heart, a man hath great parts and abilities, and hee prankes up himſelfe therein, if there bee nothing will cure this timpany, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will doe the deede, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19631:117"/> God knock off the wheels and leave him in the duſt, and make him the off-ſcouring of the world, yet a gratious heart though this be hard ſaith, Lord let mee have an humble heart whatever it coſts me, this man now is in good earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of the point wee have firſt here a matter of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and I know not whether wee are to condemne the evill of the world, or mourne for the evill that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the hearts and lives of men, but this is ſure, that if this be the behaviour of a ſound heart, then there is little ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uprightneſſe in the world, not to hover in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but to pitch upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which is the life of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let me make it appeare in theſe three particulars, this is a bill of inditement and falls

I meane the prophane, carnall wicked of the world, they are ſo farre from being content to have their ſinnes taken away, that they are not willing to heare of it, they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that the Miniſter ſhould meddle with them, or that any man ſhould touch them or come neare them nay there is no power outwardly that can
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19631:118"/> prevaile, no abilitie in any meanes that is able to teare theſe diſtempers away from their ſoules, and plucke the cup from the drunkard, or the dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance from the adulterer, or a faſhion from the faſhion-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they are up in armes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, nay obſerve it men muſt beware it they meddle with theſe things, they will take away mens credit and liberty, and life many times, rather then they will ſuffer their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to bee remooved, and their ſoules humbled by the power of the Word. <hi>Iohn</hi> muſt rather loſe his head, then <hi>Herod</hi> his inceſtuous adultery. Nay the league of theſe men with their luſts it is everlaſting, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.12. when the Prophet came early and late ſpeaking to the people, this is the good and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient way walk in it, mark how they anſwer, we will walke in our owne wayes, and as
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19631:118"/> they reſolved ſo they did, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.5. the Text ſaith, when the Prophet came to ſpeake to them, and informe them of their wicked wayes, and plucke away their corruptions, they tooke hold upon their deceits, the phraſe is ſtrange, this is all the quarrell in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Miniſter and the hearts of the people; we come to plucke away your ſinnes, wee would pull downe your proud heart, and ſubdue your curſed diſtempers, and you take hold of your luſts, you take hold of pride and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue proud ſtill, you take hold of malice, and you will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſtill, in deſpight of God and Miniſters, and counſels, and directions and what ever comes to the contrary; looke as the Philiſtims dealt with the Arke, ſo theſe prophane carnall hearts deale with the Word of the Lord, when it comes to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19631:119"/> take away their diſtempers, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 4.9. when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> brought the Arke into the Campe, they began to be amazed, and ſaid there was never ſuch a thing before, therefore ſay they, <hi>ſtrengthen your hand, O yee Philiſtims, and quit your ſelves, that yee be not ſervants to the Hebrewes.</hi> The Arke was a type of Chriſt now if they would have beene ruled by Chriſt, and have received him they might have beene bleſſed by Chriſt, but all is gone when the arke comes to take away their ſinnes, therefore they joyne hand in hand, and ſtrengthen themſelves againſt him, ſo it is with a naughty and carnall heart, when they ſee the word of God cloſe, that the miniſtery of the Goſpel is keene and pierceth, when a man ſhall not hover in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that a man may bee a Chriſtian, and prophane, (a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19631:119"/> ſwearing, lying, prophane Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) but the word will pluck away every corruption, and maſter every luſt, when they finde the miniſtery thus ſtrong, and the Word thus keene, and the worke of Gods Spirit thus mighty, they arme themſelves and ſay, Play the men O yee <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtines,</hi> they bend head, and hand, and heart together; looke either to maſter the power of the Word, or to lay downe the power of your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore take heede of the nice, preciſe, curious courſe that the word reveales, and the miniſters would preſſe upon you. The reſolution of theſe men is that of <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Naomi,</hi> they ſay to their ſinnes as they did, nothing but death ſhall part us, the contentious man will part with his eſtate, before hee will part with his brangling, ſo the ambitious man will be content that God
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19631:120"/> ſhall take away his Word and Spirit, but ſhall not take away his vaine glory, you will not part with your ſinnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till death, why you ſhall live in your ſinnes here, and you ſhall bee damned for ever for your ſinne; wee have now done with the carnall Goſpeller and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Wee will now trade in the ſecond place with the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hypocrite, I uſe this terme becauſe it fits the paſſage of the point in hand, and he is caſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and caſt out, as not ſharing in, as not partaking of the leaſt dramme of uprightneſſe of heart, this indulgent hypocrite, I compare to a fond cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring father, that never loves to have his child out of his ſight, but if hee die, hee will die with him almoſt: So this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, hee is not willing to ſee an everlaſting divorce
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19631:120"/> betweene ſinne and his ſoule, he hath ſome ſecret haunt of heart, and diſtemper of ſpirit, and hee will leave them now and then a little, but hee will not part wholly with them, the ſoule of the hypocrite is hankering after thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſtempers of ſpirit, and though ſometimes the Word doth overpower him, and the worke of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth make him, not dare to live with his ſinnes, yea hee will meete with his ſinnes as occaſion ſerves, and they will mainetaine their old league and friendſhip in this caſe, as it is with a cockering father, when ſometimes the friends perſwade him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie forceth him, and hee ſeeth hee muſt put out his child to ſchoole, or elſe hee will be ſpoiled, loath he is to have him goe out of ſight, but goe hee muſt, therefore goe he ſhall,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19631:121"/> but his concluſion is this, hee will ſee him once a quarter, or every good time: or looke as it is with ſervants in a family that intend marriage before the maſter be acquainted with it, though the maſter turne one of them out of the houſe, that they doe not dwell together, yet they will meete one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conferre with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as occaſion ſerves. So it is with this indulgent hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, he is very tender over his old ancient darling diſtempers, privie pride, and ſecret ſelfe-love, and carnall confidence, and earthly mindedneſſe, he is not able to part wholy with theſe, but if reaſon force him, and conſcience preſſe him, and he muſt part with his profit if he be covetous, then with a ſad heart hee parts with his baſe profit, away you muſt, I muſt couzen, no more; and eaſe away you muſt, I muſt ſuffer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19631:121"/> for the cauſe of Chriſt, but though he puts them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wings, thus for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet he will not have them goe farre, but he muſt heare of them, and ſee them at ſome ſeaſons: ſo the Tradeſman, he hath his fingers knockt off from baſe dealings and falſe weights, and meaſures, but when the faire comes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage comes, hee will ſend for couzening againe; ſo hee that prizeth his liberty more than the Goſpell and truth, and he that prizeth his honour more than Gods honor, &amp; yet ſaith he muſt abandon all, and forſake al if dangers approach, and miſeries are at hand, then he can ſend for ſecuririe, and ſhift for himſelfe, and by baſe dealing maintaine his owne quiet: this I take to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent hypocrite, and mee thinkes it is like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19631:122"/> with the hand of God, and the judgements of God purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Exod,</hi> 8.28. he could not beare it out, and therefore was content to let the people goe and ſacrifice to the Lord, but goe not farre, ſaith he; ſo this indulgent hypocrite ſaith, eaſe, you and I muſt part, and profit, you and I muſt part, but goe not farre in the meane time, let me heare of you as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerves: this is the guiſe of this hypocrite, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed profeſſely oppoſite to ſoundneſſe and uprightneſſe, and this wretched hypocriticall perſon, diſcovers the falſeneſſe of his heart in three particulars, firſt, if there be ſearch made, or information given touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſinnes, hee will not be knowne of it, hee will not be ſeene to owne any ſinne in the world, but hee puts a new ſuite and a new tyre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his baſe courſes, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19631:122"/> away and ſhift to make that he doth lawfull, and then no man ſhall condemne that he doth as unlawfull: it is a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie paſſage, it is with the ſoule as it was with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Abraham</hi> was very fearefull becauſe his wife was beautifull, leaſt hee ſhould be ſlaine for her ſake; now marke the covenant, <hi>Therefore ſay I am thy brother,</hi> ſay ſo though ſhe lied. So ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, corruptions make a covenant with a corrupt heart, as covetouſneſſe makes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with a miſerable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall baſe heart, and ſaith, if the caſe ſo require it; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the Church expects it, that I ſhould give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what liberally, if any ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion comes, ſaith the ſoule to covetouſneſſe, I am reſolved not to give, but to be cloſe-fiſted: but then ſome will ſay this man is a covetous man, oh
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19631:123"/> ſay not you ſo by any meanes, but ſay I have a great family and a great charge, and then I ſhall ſave my money and my credit too, now covetouſneſſe is no more covetouſneſſe, it hath put on a new ſuite, it is fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity now. So eaſe and liberty make an agreement with the ſoule, if it be ſo that I muſt bee compelled to ſuffer, the times are dangerous, if miſery and calamity ſhould come upon us, I am reſolved to ſuffer nothing, but ſay not ſo by no meanes, but if any man ſay, you will not performe your duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you bee forced to your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſay not ſo, but ſay thus, my conſcience is fully informed upon good grounds, though I am not informed yet, ſay ſo, and I ſhall ſave my eaſe and honour and all, this is baſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonage, the ſoule deales in this kind as <hi>Rahel</hi> with the Idolls, or <hi>Rahab</hi> with the ſpies, when
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19631:123"/> 
               <hi>Laban</hi> came to inquire of his Idolls, ſhee tooke the Idolls and ſate upon them, and ſhee let him ſearch all the ſtuffe but that, and her excuſe was the cuſtome of women was upon her, ſo the indulgent hypocrite, he will be content to have his heart and life ranſackt and ſearcht, till it comes to his idoll pri<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e or vaine glory, or time ſerving, but if it come to this Idoll, the ſoule will ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Idoll, and then it is not the Idoll, but a kinde of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie he doth pretend, ſo tell the faſhion-monger of this and that, it is not pride, but it is comlineſſe, the faſhion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but comlineſſe is ever; this now is a cockering hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it be ſo that this wretched heart be both infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and his conſcience be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is a ſinne hee muſt amend it, and ought to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19631:124"/> reforme it, then the ſecond paſſage is this, he doth goe very ſlowly about the reformation of this, he whyles off the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt his ſinne, hee ſaith it muſt be ſo and ought to be ſo, and hee will take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time to reforme the ſinne, and in the meane time he commits the ſinne, looke as it is with a ſleepie Magiſtrate or cockering father, if a man pleade to one of the miſorder of the towne that muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and to other that the child hath done things that cannot be excuſed, they ſay it is true, and I will take a time to requite it ſaith the father, and obſerve a convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reforme it, but the one neglects the child, and corrects it not, and the other neglects the ſinne and reformes it not, this is falſe dealing with the Lord, this is a lively picture of an indulgent hypocrite,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19631:124"/> ſometimes reaſon convinceth him and hee yeeldeth; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I ſhould pray in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and I confeſſe my heart is cowardly and baſe, and I ſhould ſuffer for Chriſt, and let libertie and honour lye rather then let the cauſe of Chriſt goe, but alas what ſhould I doe? I ſhall take a convenient time to reforme theſe things, all things cannot be done at once, threaten their ſinnes and they will require it, but in the meane time they pardon their ſinnes, I will pray in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and reforme my ſervants, but that time of reformation will never come, they are loath to deale hardly, loath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to reformation of the evills that are deare and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto them, you know what he ſayd, father I will goe into the Vineyard but went not, and they in <hi>Deut.</hi> all that the Lord hath commanded,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19631:125"/> we will doe, but did it not, they were all ſhell and no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if hee doe proceede or be forced to proceede, and labour for the reformation of his ſinnes, the third paſſage is this, hee will not deale tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, hee will not deale keenely with his corruptions, but hee will dally with it, he will not have a totall ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, and a thorough exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt ſinne, but onely a moderation, and ſome conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at ſinne, though he layes ſome kinde of puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and ſnubs his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet he will not kill it, hee threatens his evill and reformes it in ſome meaſure but hee will not abandon it utterly, that he may never have more ſocietie with it, take notice of the guiſe of this hypocrite, you ſhall commonly have him complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of too harſh preaching,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19631:125"/> there is wiſedome in all things, theſe things are able to gaſter a mans conſcience, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie mens ſoules, the Engliſh of it is this, take heed that you doe not ſmite ſinne too hard, and torment the devill too much, you ſhall hardly heare of a good heart that is ſenſible of his ſinne and tired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but hee thinkes, more of that Lord, and yet more ſharpely and keene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am afraid that the Word will not come cloſe enough, and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter will not meete with my ſinnes and plucke away my corruptions from mee; when <hi>Abſalon</hi> rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>David,</hi> and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt his kingdome, hee gives this charge, deale kindly with the young man for my ſake, hee hath dealt baſely with mee, but deale kindly with him for my ſake,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19631:126"/> as who ſhould ſay, hee muſt be ſuppreſſed I confeſſe it, hee muſt bee ſubdued I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, but take him, doe not kill him by no meanes; ſo this hypocriticall heart ſaith, deale kindly with pride, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not part with it, deale kindly with carnall confidence, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without it: a man may dally though he commit not adultery, a man may pot it a little, though he be not drunke, oh deale kindly with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deale kindly with wantonnes, theſe are the guiſes of wretched hypocrites: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I beſeech you obſerve it, a gracious heart is like that ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8. the Lord gave this charge, <hi>If thy brother the ſonne of thy mother, or thy ſonne, or the ſonne of thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the wife of thy boſome, or thy friend which is as thine owne ſoule ſhall entice thee ſecretly, let us goe ſerve other gods, thou
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19631:126"/> ſhalt not ſpare him;</hi> this is the frame of a gracious heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and of a ſound heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that is content to have his corruptions, though never ſo deare removed from him, that will not pitty his ſinne, that will ſhew no mercie to pride, no mercie to earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe, but will ſlay them, this is ſound dealing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede. Wee ſee then all this while, that this man hides his ſinne and will not be knowne of it, and when he knowes it, he will not kill it but put in bayle, and when hee doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede againſt it, hee will not ſlay it, but onely ſnibbe it a little, this is a rotten naughtie heart, it is not content to part with his ſinnes, which is the frame of every good heart.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place, it is a word of exhortation, you ſee the way, walke in it, you ſee what God requires, doe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19631:127"/> what you know, you ſee what a ſincere heart will doe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call and knocke at one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others doore, is my heart good you beare in hand, ſo this will trie it, a good heart is content to part with any corruption, art thou ſo? ſay it is ſo? aske thy heart, am I content to part with the world, and idleneſſe and pride, are you content to pray in your family, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your ſervants? then you have ſincere hearts, goe your wayes, and goe comfortably, goe cheerefully, and the God of heaven goe with you, if there be a Saint in heaven, thou art one heare upon earth, if there be a ſound heart in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou haſt a ſound heart here, though thou art weake and feeble, but doe it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe now, doe not pretend faire, and fall ſhort, halfe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and halfe out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> body out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and heart
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19631:127"/> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but take away all, and then the worke is ſincere, profit might perſwade you to this, doe not trouble your ſelves to thinke, if I leave all my ſinfull courſes what will become of my comfort, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and contentment? Why, you ſhall not loſe theſe, but onely alter theſe and change them for better, what profit is it to be proud, and dogged, and waward, and ſnarling at Gods truth? What profit is got by covetouſneſſe and cheating? all theſe profits and pleaſures and contentments, are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and lying vanitie, there is woe in all thy wealth, and poyſon in all thy proſperity, and the beſt are but temporary, and mutable, inſufficient, but part with theſe, and have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall joy and everlaſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and durable riches, doe but change therefore, it is not the leaving of theſe, but the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19631:128"/> laying out of theſe; a man will doe much for a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, he that hath a faire bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and a great penny worth, though hee hath ſo me old gold, hee is loath to part, withall, yet if for ſo many hundreds as hee layes downe ſhall have ſo many hundreds a yeare, he will art with his old gold for ſuch a purchaſe; ſo you ſhall not loſe your profit and pleaſure and contentment, but lay them out for a greater fold; <hi>He that leaves father or mother or friends for my ſake ſhall have a hundred fold heres and everlaſting happineſſe here, after;</hi> the purchaſe is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therefore bring out your old gold, thoſe old pleaſures, thoſe old contentments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the world, bring all out, and lay all downe before Chriſt, and part with all for Chriſt, and you ſhall receive comfort here, and everlaſting
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19631:128"/> happineſſe hereafter; but if profit cannot prevaile with you, yet let danger force you hereunto: know therefore there is danger in the neglect thereof, if you would not have God take away your ſinnes, the truth is, God will take away his mercy from you, and God will take away his grace and ſpirit from you, you ſhall never have it upon theſe termes: is there any man ſuch a babe in nature, that hee will not part with the wound that will kill him; is there any man ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that hee will not take that phyſicke which ſhould purge him, when he knowes it will recover him? Take notice of it, one of theſe two things you muſt take, either part with thy ſinne, or part with happineſſe, either ſuffer God to take away thy ſinnes, or elſe he will take away his mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. <hi>Thou art a God that lovest not wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19631:132"/> we have their ſucceſſe, God will not heare them: In the former wee have ſeverall particulars to be obſerved; firſt, they ſought the Lord, and called upon the Lord, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſcornefull wretches, and wicked reprobates ſought the Lord; ſecondly, obſerve the time when they ſought him, when their calamities did come like a whirlewinde, In the day of trouble then they crie and call, and cry unto the Lord; the laſt thing is from the manner of it, it was not ſlightly, but they cried unto the Lord; and withall the Text ſaith, <hi>They ſought him early,</hi> that ſheweth their earneſtnes, and their crying that ſheweth their vehemency, and yet the ſucceſſe is this, the Lord will not anſwer: they ſhall not find him. In the Verſe wee have three points of great uſe: the firſt is from the time, <hi>Then ſhall
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19631:132"/> call.</hi> The Point is this, <hi>That ſcornefull perſons in the time of affliction, are forced to ſeeke, and to ſue unto the Lord.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that when they doe ſeeke, they ſeeke ſomewhat vehemently, and earneſtly; the third is this, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they doe thus ſeeke, yet the Lord will not anſwer. The firſt point is this, <hi>That ſcornefull wretches in the time of affliction are forced to ſeeke unto the Lord;</hi> They that have neglected prayer formerly, when trouble comes, and deſolation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth, then they call and ſeeke for favour: In the 78. <hi>Pſalme, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 4. This is plaine, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when the Lord ſlew them, then they ſought him, ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 25.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19631:133"/> of you, you wil not viſit him but in the time of trouble, then the Lord ſhall be acquainted with you; Experience teacheth this when a man is upon the wracke, then hee confeſſeth his ſinnes, and then the Lord rends a yrayer from him, and then hee confeſſeth like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, I have ſinned, and I and my people are wicked, but God is juſt and righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19.

               </gap>adding after a King, <hi>Samuel</hi> made a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous elegant gracious Sermon unto them, exhorting them not to forſake the Lord, but they ſay in the eight Chapter, Nay, but we will have a King; as who ſhold ſay, have you ſaid what you will, is your Sermon done, why, yet we will have a King, but; but when the Lord thundered from heaven, then they cried, wee have ſinned, he is a terrible God, wee ſee now
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19631:133"/> he is an angry God, wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it now we have ſinned, pray for us, and to the reſt of our ſinnes we have added this, in asking us a King, when the Lord ſent his judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, then they deſired fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and pardon, and deſireth the Prophet to pray for them. The reaſons of the Point are two; the firſt is this, becauſe nature it ſelfe is proffeſſely croſſe unto trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is tired therewith, and is deſirous to be eaſed thereof; and howſoeuer a man be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unreaſonable, no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell takes place in him, yet the Word prevailes not with him, and God cannot rule, yet hee carrieth nature about with him, hee is a man ſtill, he hath fleſh and bloud ſtill, therefore when Gall comes to his heart, and the Wormewood into his ſoule, Nature it ſelfe will make him in regard of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19631:134"/> that lieth upon him to ſeeke unto God, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after meanes, to eaſe and refreſh him: yon know how it is with rebellious children, a froward little one however he will heare no counſell, not receive any direction from the Parents, yet when the rod comes, and falls heavily, they will downe on their knees, and aske forgiveneſſe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forceth this, hee feeles the blow, and ſo uſeth meanes to be eaſed, even nature compells us to ſeeke for caſe, and call for ſuccour in the time of trouble; Nay, the beaſts though never ſo ſturdy, yet the bit in their mouthes, and the ſhackles on their heeles, and the whippe on their backe, will make them teachable and tractable; nature teacheth us this, therefore ſo long as nature is in a man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions force the ſoule being tired with miſery for to ſeeke
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19631:134"/> and call and uſe meanes to be ſuccoured. The ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe all other meanes are helpes in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeeke to God becauſe all other comforts faile: in the 107 <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> 20. the Prophet ſpeakes of thoſe that travell by ſea, when they are toſſed by the waves, then they call upon God; as who ſhould ſay, ſo long as any thing would doe it, God ſhall never heare of them, but when all helpes and meanes faile, then God muſt helpe or no one can. Take a man when outward afflictions ceaze upon him, as in the time of death, friends may talke to him, and companions may mourne for him, but all now leave him in the lurch, unleſſe the Lord helpe they cannot, therefore they are forced to repaire to the Lord, and to viſit him with their prayers, ſo
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19631:135"/> then the argument is this, if it be ſo that nature forceth a man in the time of trouble to ſeeke for eaſe, and if it be ſo that all other meanes cannot helpe a man but onely the Lord, then no marvell and that in the time of diſtreſſe, the wicked ſeeke unto the Lord for comfort. This is the firſt uſe of the point, is it ſo that ſcoffers in the day of trouble are forced to ſeeke unto the Lord, then this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commends the price and worth of Gods ordinance, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying and the like, becauſe in the heavieſt times, at a dead lift, when all faile, wicked men then ſelves are forced to take up theſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, take a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard or an adulterer on his death-bed then let all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in the world bee offered him, you ſee how unprofitable they are, it is a vexation to the drunkard to ſee his campanion,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19631:135"/> nay all the pleaſures of the adulterer they are as ſo much gall to his conſcience, becauſe he hath delighted in thoſe dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances. Now when all the profits and pleaſures in the world are not able to comfort them, then ſend for a Miniſter that he may pray for me, pray for you? why I had thought you had not ſtood in neede of prayer, is prayer come into any reckoning with you, what is the reaſon of this? why they that ſcorned prayer formerly, now at the day of death and time of affliction then nothing but Miniſters, and Chriſtians, and prayer, why? the reaſon is, nothing elſe will hold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and give a man comfort in the day of diſtreſſe, therefore let us prize thoſe meanes of ſalvation, that will be ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and comfortable when all other meanes faile, it is true that wicked men in their
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19631:136"/> mad moods, and wicked fits, ſcoffe and are deſpiſers of the ordinances of God, and what needs this praying and this Bible carrying, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of Sabboths, and ſeeking of God; this is in a drunken moode, but when they come to their wits againe in the day of death and time of trouble, they admire then <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuch holy courſes, and they will ſeeke ſuch godly courſes when trouble comes, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but prayer and good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then hee ſets a high price and commendation upon theſe courſes, ſee them therefore and love them becauſe they will bee in account when the day of diſtreſſe comes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doe afflictions many times force a ſcorner to ſeeke unto God, then take notice of the fearefull ſtubborneneſſe of ſuch kinds of ſpirits that all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and plagues doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19631:136"/> their ſoules to be humbled and to ſeeke for that favour of God which they ſtand in neede of; goe thou therefore that art ſuch a one, and reaſon thus with thy ſelfe, good Lord what a wretched, knotty, ſturdy heart have I? how many judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath God ſent upon the nation, how many upon my particular, how many upon my family, and yet this ſoule is not humbled and inlarged to ſeeke unto the Lord and call upon his name, as the divels almoſt would doe, what a vile unreaſonable diſtemper is this, one judgement after another, and one plague after another, did cauſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to confeſſe his ſinnes, the Lord did wreſt it out of him, nay the divels beleeve and tremble, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.19. Good Lord? I beſeech you thinke of it, what a hard hearted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> confeſſe his ſinnes, and what doe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19631:137"/> beleeve and tremble at the wrath of God, why then what a hard heart haſt thou, that the Lord flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hell fire in thy face and ſendeth plague after plague, and yet never touched and humbled, all wreſts not one prayer from thee. In the third place it is a ground to teach us thus much, never place much confidence in thoſe prayers that are wrung out of a man by force of affliction, the Lord plucks it out of thee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt or no, he will make the ſtouteſt hearts to come in, ſcorners, reprobates, they pray, the Lord makes; them cry and howle and call daily upon him, and yet all this while nature forceth them, therefore truſt not thou to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced prayer in the day of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt forced, is commonly moſt falſe, and therefore ſhall
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19631:137"/> finde little acceptance, it was a ſpeech of a good man that the repentance of a dying man, it is commonly a great feare of a dying repentance, ſo I ſay when a man lives wickedly all his life time, and then thinkes that a few lazie wiſhes in the time of trouble will ſerve the turne, take heed, hypocrites doe thus, and ſcorners doe thus, and yet are never heard, but rejected, the Lord hee loves prayer and holy duties in the dayes of peace, and when a prayer comes out of love to God, and love to the duty, there is ſome comfort in this, but little comfort can I or any Miniſter give you in the time of ſickeneſſe, if you never uſed to ſeeke to God in the time of health, for you ſeeke onely when you are forced thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>The next point is this, that the ſeeking of ſcorners is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19631:138"/> earneſt and vehement, but we will come to the third which is this, ſcornefull men, wicked men, they may ſeeke, God earneſtly, they may call upon him vehemently, and yet never bee heard, never receive any mercy or acceptance from him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13, 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight gate, for many ſhall ſtrive to enter, but ſhall not be able,</hi> it is not any mans power to be able to enter; no, no, many ſhall ſeeke this but ſhall not be able. Adde to this <hi>John</hi> 8.21. It is the heavie doome of Chriſt upon the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>yee ſhall ſeeke me</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but ſhall die in your ſinnes;</hi> as who ſhould ſay I offered you, grace you refuſed it, I come home to you, you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me not, the time will come, when I will lay anguiſh on your hearts, and horrour on your ſoules, and then you ſhall ſeeke me but ſhall not find me,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19631:138"/> but ſhall die in your ſinnes, you will have your ſinnes, I cannot remove them, you will not ſuffer me to take place with you, the truth is, you ſhall die in your ſinnes, take your proud hearts and goe downe to hell with them, take them, and periſh with them, I goe to my father to heaven, but you ſhall never come there: Our Saviour ſaith, the time ſhall come that you ſhall ſeeke me, and ſhall not finde me, but die in your ſinnes; but you will ſay, if they may ſeeke, call, and yet not finde, how comes this to paſſe, is not ſeeking the way to finding, is not calling the way to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, hath not God ſaid, if you aske any thing in my ſonnes name, you ſhall receive it? I ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe; <hi>You aske and have not</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe you aske amiſſe;</hi> ſo I ſay to you, yee ſeeke and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19631:139"/> finde not, becauſe you ſeeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe: Though they call with violence, and ſeeke with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie: yet it is not ſuite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods rule, and that is the reaſon they doe not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: now the reaſons why their ſeeking doe not ſpeede are three; firſt, they ſeeke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, when the Lord happily hath taken away the meanes of ſalvation, when the time is paſt, and the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is over, when God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the meanes, as alſo the bleſſings upon the meanes; in the 25. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the five fooliſh Virgins went for oyle, and when the time was paſt, and the doore was ſhut, then they knocke at heaven gates, open to us, but the doore was ſhut, they that ſtood upon the watch, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Lords comming, they entered into the bride Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seeke the Lord,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19631:139"/> while he may be found,</hi> that is, while the meanes of grace are continued, while Wiſedome is crying, and the Lord Ieſus is holding out his golden Scepter of mercie and ſalvation: Now is the day of ſalvation, now is the time accepted, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether the Lord will cover the heavens, and take away the light of the Goſpell, and make us wander in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Rockes, and Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; if deſolation ſhould come wee muſt be driven from our houſes and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, here one man alone, there one woman alone, and there a child crying, and the third dying, then we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what opportunities wee have had and neglected, the Lord was neare to us in the uſe of the meanes, but now the time is paſt, the Goſpell and opportunities are gone, he that ſeekes unſeaſonably may ſinke
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19631:140"/> downe, and never enjoy meanes and helpes, and the bleſſing of God upon them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.21. God gave <hi>Ieſabel</hi> a day of repentance, but ſhee repented not, therefore hee would caſt her into a bed of ſorrow, ſhe loved bedding and eaſe, and pleaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ſhee had a time of repentance, but ſhee would not take it, therefore becauſe ſhee loved bedding, ſhee ſhall have enough, ſhee ſhall have a bed of ſorrow, and anguiſh, that is the firſt ground, that ſeeke unſeaſonably: ſecondly, they ſeek upon a falſe ground, it is not out of hatred of ſin, that they ſeeke for mercy but out of horror of conſcience, it is not out of loathſomneſſe of corruption, but by reaſon of the burthenſomneſſe that lieth upon their hearts; it is not for holineſſe they labour, but for quiet, eaſe, and contentedneſſe,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19631:140"/> that they might not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and vexed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36. The Text ſaith thoſe that did ſeeke the Lord when hee plagued them, diſſembled in their hearts, they pretended to ſeeke the Lord, and worſhip the Lord, but they did not ſeeke the Lord but their owne eaſe and diſſembled fearefully and abuſed the Lords mercy and patience that he had vouchſafed unto them; looke as it is with the dogge, hee doth not caſt up his vomit, becauſe he loathes it, but hee is weary of it, hee loves it ſtill, therefore lickes it up again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, he did not caſt it up out of loathſomneſſe of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did trouble his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke; ſo it is with a carnall hypocrite in the horrour of heart and anguiſh of ſpirit; it is not for love of holineſſe but of quiet, that he renteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and ſaith, I have hated
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19631:141"/> Gods people, profaned the Sabboth, and committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſecretly, he would vomit and confeſſe his ſinnes, and crave mercie, not becauſe hee loaths his ſinne, but he loathes anguiſh and horrour of heart, and when that is taken away, he falls to his vomit and baſe practice. Thirdly, they ſeeke to a falſe end, hee doth not ſeeke grace for a Chriſts ſake, and Chriſt for the love of a Chriſt, to have union with him, but hee ſeekes grace not to have have ſinne removed, but to have a kind of ſafeneſſe in his ſinne; a wretch in the deſperate anguiſh of ſpirit ſeekes unto a Saviour, as to a Surgeon, not that hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſinne, but that he may be the more quiet in ſinne, hee would have Chriſt pardon ſinne, that hee may commit ſinne with quietneſſe, not to have him take away his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19631:141"/> corruptions, and convert his ſoule, but to heale the wound, and to take away the bitterneſſe of ſorrow, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58 34. A company of wicked wretches ſeemed to ſeeke the Lord by faſting, but they did not ſeeke the Lord, but their owne luſts, they faſted that they might continue in their baſe courſes, with more quietneſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſtraction, or ſuſpition, as a malefactor after hee is attached and condemned, hee will ſeeke a pardon, and ſue for it, not that hee might become better afterwards, but for quiet and libertie, that hee may not be hanged, ſo a cunning chapman is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to attend and pray, that he may couzen and cheate, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and praying ſo much the more: ſo then gather up the Point, if they ſeeke out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, out of falſe grounds, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19631:142"/> to a wrong end; no marvell then though they call earneſtly and ſeeke vehemently, and yet God anſwers not, nor is found of them according to their deſires.</p>
            <p>The firſt Vſe is for terrour, Is it ſo that a man may ſeeke earneſtly, and yet never obtaine mercy, then this is able to ſhake and ſinke a company of ſoules of carnall wretches: Oh, the lamentable condition of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poore creatures that live in the boſome of the Church, and therefore it falls ſore upon thoſe creatures that make a ſcoffe at praying, and hearing all ignorant and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſons, that know not how to pray and ſeeke to the Lord for grace and mercie; me thinkes the former truth were ſufficient to daſh all the carnall hope that can creepe into the minde of ſuch creatures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take notice of the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19631:142"/> condition wherein they lie; Reaſon thus, Is it ſo, that thoſe that ſeeke the Lord ſhall never finde him, then what ſhall become of me that never cried at all, nay, that loath prayer, and reject the uſe of Gods ordinances, and diſpiſe the meanes of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby I muſt ſeeke and obtaine mercy if ever I have it; if they that doe ſeeke attaine not, then I that never ſeeke, my condition is deſperately la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, fearefully irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, why? Why, my heart riſeth at ſuch perſons; I have tanted this praying, and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this faſting, good Lord, what ſhall become of my ſoule, deſperate is my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fearefull is my eſtate, the Lord be mercifull unto me, I am gone for ever, I, grace will the Lord vouchſafe? grace to me; doe I count of mercy and pardon for my ſinnes? no
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19631:143"/> let me ſet my heart at eaſe, thoſe dayes are gone I mercie, no, I have loathed and ſcorned mercie, the day will come when the Lord will ſay, you have hated mercy, therefore you ſhall be condemned, and never partake thereof, nay, what will become of a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of carnall wretches, that ſet themſelves with deſperate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to hinder, and cruſh, and oppoſe the improvement of all holy meanes, if there be any ſervant in their family, that riſeth early to pray to the Lord, if there be any child that is godly, and a wife that lookes towards <hi>Sion,</hi> there is an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare in the family, the maſter he flieth about, and ſaith, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintaine my family by poaring on a booke, how then doſt thou get thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving if not by praying and reading, thou gotteſt thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but a curſe with it, if

            <p>The laſt uſe is this, you will ſay what ſhall we doe if ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not get it at the hands of the Lord, then wee had as good caſt away all, and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as get nothing by what wee doe; therefore the laſt uſe is a word of exhortation, wee are to be intreated in the name of the Lord Ieſus to doe not onely what theſe ſeekers doe, but goe further, and doe more; This is no argument becauſe they obtaine not mercy by ſeeking, therefore wee ſhould not ſeeke, therefore ſeeke after another manner, ſo ſeeke and pray that you may finde bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereby, and comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in unto your ſoules, in the 13. of <hi>Luke</hi> 24. this is the uſe Chriſt makes, <hi>many ſhall ſeeke to enter in and ſhall not be able;</hi> what ſhall wee therefore caſt

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19631:145"/> hath a day and a ſeaſon which is the harveſt of ſalvation, doe you not take notice of this, that at ſome Sermon God opens the eye and prickes the conſcience, and ſometimes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly perſwades a man, and the ſoule is yeelding and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the Lord, the ſoule melts lovingly under the hand of God, this is thy day, take heede how thou neglecteſt it, and as thou goeſt home, intreat the Lord to make profitable that which thou haſt heard, and ſay this is my day, I am now in the fire, Lord melt me, I am now under the power of thy ordinance, make it effectuall to my ſoule, and take notice of it, if the ſpirit of God call and you regard it not, and let all goe, and all commodities are plucked up, and gone, you may come, and call, and cry, but it is too late; that Spirit which thou haſt reſiſted ſhall
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19631:146"/> never worke more, thanke thy ſelfe, the day is gone, now they are hidden from thine eyes, the day is over, and therefore thou maieſt crie, Oh, for a Miniſter, &amp; oh for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, no, no, if all the Angells in heaven ſhould ſpeake, and all the Miniſters on earth ſhould preach themſelves hoarſe, thou wouldeſt not be affected therewith, therefore take the ſeaſon and the golden opportunitie of grace, and when Chriſt comes to your ſoules entertaine him, if Chriſt knocks, open the doore, if hee awaken thy conſcience doe not ſnubbe it; labour now to ſee thy ſinne that thou mayeſt finde mercy at the hand of the Lord. Secondly, as wee muſt ſeeke ſeaſonably, ſo wee muſt ſeeke with our whole heart, now the whole heart makes knowne it ſelfe in two particulars; the firſt is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19631:146"/> this, when all the good things of this world, be they what they will be, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us from Chriſt, this is one part of the whole heart, when profits and pleaſures of this world ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oppoſition betweene God, and our duty to caſt off all, and ſay whether I have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and libertie or no, I care not, ſo I have God, my God I will have, this is a happy ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away therefore with that lazie heart, I thinke it ſhould be ſo, and ought to be ſo, and it is good ſanctifying the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and praying, it is mervel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reaſonable I ought to doe it, but if I doe it, eaſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will be gone, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace will be caſt upon mee, thou now ſeekeſt thy eaſe and honour, and the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will curſe thee, and thy ſeeking, but if thou diddeſt ſeeke with thy whole heart
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19631:147"/> thou wouldeſt goe thorough the worke, and ſay, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard friends and honours? let eaſe and friends looke to themſelves, let friends bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, I had rather friends ſhould be diſpleaſed then God, it is not neceſſary to be rich or honorable, but it is neceſſary to finde mercy, and to have ſinnes pardoned. Secondly, as no good thing muſt withdraw us from God, ſo no miſery muſt be a ſtoppe to let us from comming to the Lord, but we muſt breake through all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that lie betweene God and us, this is that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. as who ſhould ſay, come what can come, though heaven and earth meete together, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to doe what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, hee that ſeekes God with his whole heart, if hee were to runne thorough hell he would runne thorough it to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19631:147"/> goe to God, now away with that dawbing and hagling with the Lord: O ſaith the poore ſoule, I confeſſe the courſe is honorable, God requires it, and I ſhould doe it, but if I doe it, trouble and perſecution will befall me, what ſhall become of me and mine, will you have my wife and children undone, if thou thus ſeeke the Lord, thy ſeeking is accurſed, thou doſt not ſeeke with thy whole heart, they that ſeeke with their whole heart are like a mayd that ſets her affections ſtrong upon a man, happily her friends will be reaſoning about the portion, and there is a cavill on the one ſide, and an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the other, povertie on one ſide, and maintenance on the other ſide; but if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man love the man, for the mans ſake ſhee will ſay, let me have him though I beg and die with him, ſo it is with the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19631:148"/> ſoule of a poore Chriſtian that ſeeke, Chriſt with his whole heart, when Chriſt and grace and duty bee propounded, and the match offered, and Chriſt tendered to the ſoule and the Lord ſaith, I will bee thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer but thou muſt looke for diſgrace and miſery, and perſecution, but there is a better life a comming now, if you ſtand for a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, that you muſt have eaſe and quiet, and will not have miſery and priſon with Chriſt, then you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to make a match, but he that loves Chriſt for Chriſts ſake, the ſoule ſaith, let the Lord Ieſus be a Saviour to mee, though I beg and die, and never enjoy good day, it is enough my ſoule ſhall bee ſaved, if I ſhould rot in priſon, and bee baniſhed into the utmoſt coaſts of the earth, yet let mee have my Saviour, let him take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19631:148"/> of me, let his Spirit rule me whatſoever come of it; this is to ſeeke God with our whole heart, and now you are like to finde him. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you muſt ſeeke the Lord conſtantly, you muſt perſevere in the uſe of all meanes, looke as it is with a man that is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to finde another, and not to leave ſeeking till hee hath found him; he goeth firſt to his houſe, he is not there, he was gone to ſuch a place an houre before, well, hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues him thither, hee is not there, but is gone to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, hee followes him thither, when hee comes thither, hee is gone home againe, well, then backe againe hee goes to his houſe, and never leaves hunting and purſuing of him till he findes him; ſo it is with a ſoule that truly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeekes after the Lord, hee is to be found in his ordinances,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19631:149"/> haply thou commeſt to the Word and findeſt him not here, the Word ſaith hee went from hence to faſting and prayer, then thou findeſt him not there neither, then thou goeſt from faſting and prayer to holy conference, then hee is not to be found there, but is gone to the publike ordinance, in the Congregation, then thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goeſt, and wilt not be content till thou findeſt him, but goeſt backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, from the Word to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and faſting, from them to conference, from thence to the Word againe; this to ſeeke the Lord conſtantly and hee that thus ſeekes is like to obtaine, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 122.1. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee will waite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord ſheweth mercy:</hi> let this be thy reſolution, ſeeke unto God till he doe worke effectually upon thy heart, thou haſt faſted and prayed, yet
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19631:149"/> God hath not heard, why, faſt and pray ſtill untill hee ſupply what is wanting, and pardon what is amiſſe; thus never leave endeavouring and doing untill the Lord ſheweth mercie unto thy ſoule, and give the aſſurance of the pardon of thy ſinnes: thus ſeeke the Lord ſeaſonably, thus ſeeke thee Lord with all thy heart, thus ſeeke him conſtantly, thus ſeeke him with your whole heart, and hee will be found of you in mercie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
